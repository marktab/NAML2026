    "## Red / Blue / White Cell Play\n",

    "**OODA Phase: Orient / Decide / Act**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Simulate a multi-turn gray-zone maritime encounter where Red, Blue, and White cell agents play against each other. Track escalation, strategic messaging, legal compliance, and operational objectives using quantified scoring dimensions inspired by the NATO STO-MP-SAS-192 card-based wargame approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Warfighters, operational planners, strategists, and JAG officers.\n",
    "**Primary outcome:** A scored game log showing the interplay of escalation dynamics, legal constraints, and information warfare — consumable by Demo 5 (AAR) for live after-action review.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Responsible AI & Scope Statement:** This research explores human-AI collaboration and explainable decision-support in fully synthetic, abstract environments. All scenarios, agents, and data are artificially generated. No real-world operational data, contingency plans, systems, or intelligence are used or represented. The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority.\n"

    "| Agent | Role | Unique Contribution |\n",
    "|-------|------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Blue Planner** | Selects actions from a defined menu; scores across 5 dimensions | Balances competing equities each turn |\n",
    "| **Red Team** | Selects provocations; explains adversary reasoning transparently | Transparent adversary thought process |\n",
    "| **White Cell / Umpire** | Adjudicates outcomes; updates escalation index; announces thresholds | Published rule set, visible to audience |\n",
    "| **Legal / ROE** | Constrains Blue's actions by current ROE posture + escalation level | Not in NATO precedent — novel JAG integration |\n",

    "**Success criteria:** Over 4+ turns, escalation index rises and falls in response to Red provocations and Blue decisions. The Legal agent visibly constrains actions. StratComm messages create second-order effects. The Explainability Agent produces a transparent reasoning trace each turn. The game log is a valid input to Demo 5.\n"

We call the model via its inference endpoint. |\n",

    "| **[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview)** | A cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Applications retrieve secrets at runtime instead of hard-coding them in source files. | Stores the `AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` (API key) so it never appears in notebooks or version control. The shared `common/config.py` module retrieves secrets from Key Vault using `DefaultAzureCredential`. |\n",

    "The cell below builds an `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` — the bridge between AutoGen agents and the LLM hosted on Azure AI Foundry. Here is what each piece does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Endpoint & Credential** — The client reads `AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` (your model deployment URL) and `AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` (your API key) from environment variables. These are set in your `.env` file or injected by Azure ML Compute. Secrets should be managed via [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model ID** — `DEFAULT_MODEL` identifies which model to call (e.g., `gpt-4o`). Azure AI Foundry supports [many models from different providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/model-catalog-overview) through a single endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Capabilities (`model_info`)** — AutoGen needs to know what the model supports (vision, function calling, JSON mode, etc.) so it can format requests correctly. This metadata is set manually here because the Azure AI Inference API serves multiple model families.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temperature** — Controls response randomness. Lower values (closer to 0) produce more deterministic outputs; higher values (closer to 1) produce more creative variation.\n",

    "## Agent Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Six AutoGen `AssistantAgent`s with specialized system prompts. Each prompt defines the agent's role, action menu, output format, and decision constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How AutoGen Agents Work with Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent below is an [`AssistantAgent`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent) — the core building block of the [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/) multi-agent framework. Key concepts for Azure newcomers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`system_message`** — A detailed prompt that defines the agent's persona, responsibilities, available actions, and output format. This is sent to the LLM at the start of every conversation. The prompts below are long and domain-specific; they encode the wargame rules directly so the model can follow them without external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`model_client`** — Every agent shares the same `AzureAIChatCompletionClient`, which routes all LLM calls to a single model deployment on [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry). You can also assign different models to different agents (e.g., a smaller model for simple tasks, a larger model for complex reasoning) by creating additional clients pointing to different deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`description`** — A short string that helps AutoGen's orchestration layer understand what the agent does. Used by selector-based group chats (not this demo) to route conversations dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No tools/function calling** — These agents use pure chat completion — the LLM generates structured text responses rather than calling external functions. AutoGen also supports [tool-use agents](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/tools.html) that can invoke Python functions, query databases, or call Azure services.\n",

    "## Turn Orchestration Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Each turn follows a fixed sequence: **Red acts → Legal constrains → Blue responds → White adjudicates → StratComm assesses → Explainability traces**. A `RoundRobinGroupChat` enforces ordering. Scores and escalation update after White Cell adjudication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Multi-Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell uses [`RoundRobinGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) — one of AutoGen's built-in team patterns that calls each agent in a fixed order. Here's how the orchestration works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Team assembly** — Six agents are placed into a `RoundRobinGroupChat`. Each turn, the team receives a task message describing the current game state.\n",
    "2. **Sequential execution** — The group chat passes the conversation to each agent in order. Each agent sees all prior messages (including other agents' outputs), so later agents can react to earlier ones (e.g., Blue reads Legal's assessment before choosing an action).\n",
    "3. **Termination condition** — A [`MaxMessageTermination`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.conditions.html) stops the round after exactly 6 messages (one per agent).\n",
    "4. **Streaming** — `Console(team.run_stream(...))` streams agent responses token-by-token, so the audience sees each agent thinking in real time. Every token is generated by the LLM on [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) and streamed back via the Azure AI Inference API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Other team patterns:** AutoGen also offers [`SelectorGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html) (an LLM picks the next speaker dynamically) and [`Swarm`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html) (agents hand off using transfer functions). See the [AutoGen teams guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/teams.html)."
