        "1. **Endpoint & Credential** — The client reads `AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` (your model deployment URL) and `AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` (your API key) from environment variables. These are set in your `.env` file or injected by Azure ML Compute. Secrets should be managed via [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in production.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Model Capabilities (`model_info`)** — AutoGen needs to know what the model supports (vision, function calling, JSON mode, etc.) so it can format requests correctly. This metadata is set manually here because the Azure AI Inference API serves multiple model families.\n",

This is sent to the LLM at the start of every conversation. The prompts below are long and domain-specific; they encode the wargame rules directly so the model can follow them without external tools.\n",

        "\n",
        "This cell uses [`RoundRobinGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) — one of AutoGen's built-in team patterns that calls each agent in a fixed order. Here's how the orchestration works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Team assembly** — Six agents are placed into a `RoundRobinGroupChat`. Each turn, the team receives a task message describing the current game state.\n",
        "2. **Sequential execution** — The group chat passes the conversation to each agent in order. Each agent sees all prior messages (including other agents' outputs), so later agents can react to earlier ones (e.g., Blue reads Legal's assessment before choosing an action).\n",
        "3. **Termination condition** — A [`MaxMessageTermination`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.conditions.html) stops the round after exactly 6 messages (one per agent).\n",
        "4. **Streaming** — `Console(team.run_stream(...))` streams agent responses token-by-token, so the audience sees each agent thinking in real time. Every token is generated by the LLM on [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) and streamed back via the Azure AI Inference API.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Other team patterns:** AutoGen also offers [`SelectorGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html) (an LLM picks the next speaker dynamically) and [`Swarm`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html) (agents hand off using transfer functions).

Shadowing the Blue vessel allows Red to monitor its movements, gather intelligence, and establish a presence in the contested area without overtly provoking an escalation. This aligns with Red's strategic goal of asserting territorial claims while avoiding actions that could justify a forceful Blue response under peacetime ROE.\n\n- **Intended effect:** Red aims to signal its territorial claim and readiness to respond without escalating the situation. This action also provides an opportunity to collect valuable data on Blue's operational patterns and capabilities.\n\n- **Risk accepted:** There is minimal risk associated with this action, as it is unlikely to provoke a strong response from Blue. However, it may be perceived as passive, potentially emboldening Blue to proceed with its mission unchallenged.\n---------- TextMessage (Legal_ROE) ----------\n**LEGAL/ROE ASSESSMENT — Turn 1**\n\n**Current ROE:** PEACETIME  \n**Escalation:** 0 (ROUTINE)  \n\n| Blue Action                        | Legal Status  | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain course and speed          | AUTHORIZED    | Consistent with freedom of navigation rights under international law.    |\n| Conduct active radar sweeps        | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive measure; does not constitute a use of force.                   |\n| Issue radio challenge to Red units | AUTHORIZED    | Non-escalatory communication to clarify intent and assert navigation.    |\n| Deploy small UAV for overwatch     | RESTRICTED    | Legal but could be perceived as escalatory surveillance.                 |\n| Conduct live-fire gunnery exercise | PROHIBITED    | Inconsistent with peacetime ROE; no hostile act/intent detected.         |\n| Alter course to avoid Red units    | RESTRICTED    | Legal but may undermine freedom of navigation assertion.                 |\n\n**ROE CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:** NO — Red's shadowing action does not meet the threshold of a hostile act or hostile intent under international law.  \n\n**KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- Under the Law of the Sea, Blue's freedom of navigation operation is lawful in contested waters unless Red's actions escalate to a clear threat or interference.  \n- Shadowing by Red is not inherently unlawful and does not justify a change in ROE posture at this stage.\n---------- TextMessage (Blue_Planner) ----------\n**BLUE ACTION — Turn 1**\n\nACTION: shadow_and_monitor\n\n- **Selected action:** shadow_and_monitor\n\n- **Reasoning:** Red's decision to shadow the BNS Resolute is a low-level provocation that does not interfere with our freedom of navigation transit. By maintaining our current course and speed while passively monitoring Red's movements, we can document their behavior without escalating tensions. This approach aligns with peacetime ROE and ensures we remain consistent with international law, reinforcing our narrative of lawful navigation.\n\n- **Tradeoffs considered:** Alternatives like issuing a radio challenge (hail_and_warn) or repositioning ISR assets (reposition_isr) were considered but rejected for now. A radio challenge could escalate unnecessarily at this early stage, and repositioning ISR assets would expend resources without immediate need. Closing to visual range (close_to_visual) was dismissed as too escalatory given the current low threat level.\n\n- **Expected effect:** This action will allow us to gather evidence of Red's shadowing behavior for potential use in strategic communications while preserving our operational focus on completing the freedom-of-navigation transit. It also avoids unnecessary escalation, keeping the situation at a manageable level.\n---------- TextMessage (White_Cell) ----------\n**WHITE CELL ADJUDICATION — Turn 1**\n\n**DTG:** T+0010H  \n\n**Actions this turn:**  \n- Red: **shadow_only** — Red's forces maintain a discreet distance while shadowing BNS Resolute, using passive sensors to monitor Blue's movements and gather intelligence.  \n- Blue: **shadow_and_monitor** — BNS Resolute maintains its course and speed, passively monitoring Red's shadowing activity with onboard sensors, without altering its behavior or initiating communication.  \n\n**INTERACTION RESOLUTION:**  \nRed's shadowing action is met with a measured response by Blue, which neither escalates nor retreats. Both sides maintain situational awareness without direct interaction. Red gathers intelligence on Blue's operational patterns, while Blue documents Red's presence for potential use in strategic communications. The situation remains stable, with no overt provocations or confrontations.  \n\n**ESCALATION UPDATE:**  \n- Previous index: 0  \n- Change: [+0] (Red: [+0], Blue: [+0])  \n- New index: 0 → **ROUTINE**  \n\n**THRESHOLD CROSSING:** NO — The escalation level remains at \"ROUTINE,\" with no significant changes in posture or behavior by either side.  \n\n**SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:**  \n- Weather: Clear skies with moderate seas; visibility remains excellent for both sides.  \n- Time of day: Late morning, with optimal conditions for visual and electronic monitoring.  \n- Nearby shipping: A civilian cargo vessel is detected approximately 15 nautical miles to the west, maintaining a steady course away from the area of operations.  \n- Media attention: No immediate coverage of the situation, though regional monitoring stations may begin to take interest if the standoff persists.  \n\nBoth sides appear to be testing the waters, metaphorically and literally, while avoiding actions that could escalate the situation prematurely.\n---------- TextMessage (StratComm) ----------\n**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS — Turn 1**  \n\n**BLUE PUBLIC STATEMENT (DRAFT):**  \n\"The BNS Resolute is conducting a routine freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law. Our mission underscores the importance of upholding the principles of free and open access to international waters, ensuring stability and security in the region.\"  \n\n**PREDICTED ADVERSARY RESPONSE:**  \nRed state media is likely to frame Blue's actions as a provocative intrusion into what they claim are their territorial waters. They may emphasize their \"measured and responsible\" response, portraying their shadowing as a necessary action to safeguard their sovereignty. Social media channels aligned with Red could amplify narratives of Blue as an aggressor, potentially using terms like \"foreign military encroachment\" to stir domestic and regional sentiment.  \n\n**INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Blue narrative strength: **MODERATE** — Blue's adherence to international law and measured response supports a narrative of professionalism and legitimacy, but the lack of immediate media coverage limits its reach.  \n- Red narrative strength: **MODERATE** — Red's framing of territorial defense resonates with domestic and potentially regional audiences, but their lack of overt action limits their ability to claim moral high ground.  \n- Key narrative battleground: **Legitimacy of territorial claims vs. international law** — The central argument revolves around whether Red's territorial claims are valid and whether Blue's actions constitute lawful navigation or provocation.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \nProactively engage regional and international media to highlight the lawful nature of Blue's operation and the importance of freedom of navigation for global trade and security. Emphasize the professionalism and restraint shown by Blue forces to preemptively counter any Red narrative of provocation. Consider releasing imagery or data that visually underscores the routine and lawful nature of the operation, such as navigation charts or footage of the calm operational environment.\n"

Deploying a swarm of maritime militia vessels to encircle or block the Blue vessel is a calculated move that demonstrates Red's resolve and territorial claim while maintaining plausible deniability. This tactic leverages non-military assets to complicate Blue's operations and test its response under peacetime ROE.\n\n- **Intended effect:** Red seeks to create operational friction for Blue by physically impeding its movement and forcing it to either alter course or escalate its response. This action also reinforces Red's narrative of civilian resistance to perceived incursions, bolstering its political messaging.\n\n- **Risk accepted:** There is a risk that Blue may perceive this action as a deliberate provocation, potentially escalating the situation. Additionally, poor coordination among militia vessels could lead to collisions or accidents, which might backfire in the information domain.\n---------- TextMessage (Legal_ROE) ----------\n**LEGAL/ROE ASSESSMENT — Turn 2**\n\n**Current ROE:** PEACETIME  \n**Escalation:** 0 (ROUTINE)  \n\n| Blue Action                        | Legal Status  | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain course and speed          | AUTHORIZED    | Consistent with freedom of navigation rights under international law.    |\n| Conduct active radar sweeps        | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive measure; does not constitute a use of force.                   |\n| Issue radio challenge to Red units | AUTHORIZED    | Non-escalatory communication to clarify intent and assert navigation.    |\n| Deploy small UAV for overwatch     | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive surveillance in response to increased Red activity.            |\n| Alter course to avoid Red units    | RESTRICTED    | Legal but may undermine freedom of navigation assertion.                 |\n| Conduct live-fire gunnery exercise | PROHIBITED    | Inconsistent with peacetime ROE; no hostile act/intent detected.         |\n| Use non-lethal means (e.g., LRAD)  | RESTRICTED    | Legal but could escalate tensions; requires clear justification.         |\n\n**ROE CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:** NO — While the deployment of militia vessels increases operational friction, it does not meet the threshold of a hostile act or hostile intent under international law.  \n\n**KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- The use of militia vessels to impede navigation is a gray area under international law. While it may violate the principle of freedom of navigation, it does not constitute an armed attack or direct threat justifying a change in ROE.  \n- Blue must carefully document Red's actions to support potential diplomatic or legal recourse while avoiding unnecessary escalation.\n---------- TextMessage (Blue_Planner) ----------\n**BLUE ACTION — Turn 2**\n\nACTION: hail_and_warn\n\n- **Selected action:** hail_and_warn\n\n- **Reasoning:** Red's deployment of militia vessels to encircle or impede the BNS Resolute represents a significant escalation in operational friction, though it remains below the threshold of a hostile act. Issuing a bridge-to-bridge radio warning citing COLREGS (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) and international law is a measured response that asserts Blue's right to freedom of navigation while documenting Red's actions. This approach signals resolve without escalating to kinetic or overtly aggressive measures.\n\n- **Tradeoffs considered:** Alternatives such as maintaining course and speed (shadow_and_monitor) or deploying a UAV for overwatch (reposition_isr) were considered. However, maintaining course without addressing the militia's actions risks emboldening Red, while deploying a UAV could be perceived as unnecessarily escalatory at this stage. More aggressive options, such as non-lethal measures (e.g., LRAD), were rejected due to their potential to escalate tensions prematurely.\n\n- **Expected effect:** This action will reinforce Blue's legal and operational position, potentially deterring further interference by Red's militia vessels. It also creates a clear record of Blue's adherence to international norms, which can be leveraged in strategic communications and legal forums.\n---------- TextMessage (White_Cell) ----------\n**WHITE CELL ADJUDICATION — Turn 2**\n\n**DTG:** T+0012H  \n\n**Actions this turn:**  \n- Red: **militia_deployment** — Red deploys a swarm of maritime militia vessels to encircle and impede the movement of BNS Resolute. The militia vessels maintain close proximity but avoid direct collisions, using their presence to create operational friction and assert territorial claims.  \n- Blue: **hail_and_warn** — BNS Resolute issues a series of bridge-to-bridge radio warnings to the militia vessels, citing COLREGS and international law. The warnings assert Blue's right to freedom of navigation and demand that the militia cease actions that impede safe passage.  \n\n**INTERACTION RESOLUTION:**  \nThe militia vessels maintain their positions around BNS Resolute, creating a challenging navigational environment but avoiding direct physical interference. Blue's radio warnings are met with silence from the militia, which continues to shadow and encircle the warship. The situation remains tense but controlled, with no physical altercations or overtly hostile actions. Both sides achieve limited objectives: Red demonstrates its resolve and territorial claim, while Blue reinforces its legal position and documents Red's actions for potential use in diplomatic or strategic communications.  \n\n**ESCALATION UPDATE:**  \n- Previous index: 0  \n- Change: [+2] (Red: [+2], Blue: [+0])  \n- New index: 2 → **ROUTINE**  \n\n**THRESHOLD CROSSING:** NO — The escalation level remains at \"ROUTINE,\" though the situation is trending toward increased tension.  \n\n**SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:**  \n- Weather: Conditions remain favorable, with clear skies and calm seas. Visibility is excellent, aiding both sides in maintaining situational awareness.  \n- Time of day: Early afternoon, with optimal lighting for visual monitoring and documentation.  \n- Nearby shipping: The civilian cargo vessel previously detected has moved further west, exiting the immediate area of operations. No additional civilian vessels are detected nearby.  \n- Media attention: Regional maritime monitoring groups have begun to report on the presence of Red militia vessels in the contested area, though coverage remains limited to specialized outlets.  \n\nThe deployment of militia vessels marks a notable shift in Red's approach, introducing new complexities for Blue's freedom of navigation operation. Both sides remain cautious, avoiding actions that could escalate the situation to a higher level of confrontation.\n---------- TextMessage (StratComm) ----------\n**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS — Turn 2**  \n\n**BLUE PUBLIC STATEMENT (DRAFT):**  \n\"The BNS Resolute continues its lawful freedom of navigation operation in international waters, despite the presence of irregular vessels attempting to impede safe passage. We remain committed to upholding international law and ensuring the free and open use of the seas for all nations.\"  \n\n**PREDICTED ADVERSARY RESPONSE:**  \nRed state media will likely frame the militia deployment as a grassroots, civilian-led effort to defend their territorial waters from foreign military intrusion. They may emphasize the non-military nature of the militia to downplay accusations of escalation, while portraying Blue's radio warnings as aggressive and unnecessary. Social media narratives may focus on portraying Blue as a destabilizing force, with imagery or videos of the militia vessels surrounding the warship to evoke sympathy and support for Red's position.  \n\n**INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Blue narrative strength: **MODERATE** — Blue's adherence to international law and measured response supports its narrative of professionalism and legitimacy, but the limited media coverage reduces its reach.  \n- Red narrative strength: **STRONG** — Red's use of militia vessels allows it to frame the situation as a civilian-led defense of sovereignty, resonating with domestic and regional audiences. The visual impact of the militia swarm may also gain traction in social media, creating a perception of Blue as an aggressor.  \n- Key narrative battleground: **Freedom of navigation vs. sovereignty defense** — The central argument is whether Blue's operation is a lawful assertion of international norms or an intrusion into Red's claimed territorial waters.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \nBlue should amplify its messaging by releasing clear evidence of the militia vessels' actions, such as radar imagery or video footage, to demonstrate the operational friction caused by Red's deployment. Emphasize the irregular and potentially unsafe nature of the militia's behavior, framing it as a reckless and irresponsible tactic that endangers maritime safety. Engage with international maritime organizations and regional partners to highlight the broader implications of Red's actions for global trade and freedom of navigation.\n"

A state media or social media campaign accusing Blue of provocation serves to delegitimize Blue's mission and bolster Red's territorial claims. This approach avoids direct escalation while amplifying Red's strategic communication efforts.\n\n- **Intended effect:** Red aims to sway international opinion by framing Blue as the aggressor, potentially creating political pressure on Blue to scale back its operations. This also reinforces Red's domestic narrative of defending its sovereignty against foreign intrusion.\n\n- **Risk accepted:** If the disinformation is easily debunked or perceived as overly aggressive, it could backfire and strengthen Blue's credibility. Additionally, this action may not directly impede Blue's operational progress, allowing them to continue their mission unchallenged.\n---------- TextMessage (Legal_ROE) ----------\n**LEGAL/ROE ASSESSMENT — Turn 3**\n\n**Current ROE:** PEACETIME  \n**Escalation:** 1 (ROUTINE)  \n\n| Blue Action                        | Legal Status  | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain course and speed          | AUTHORIZED    | Consistent with freedom of navigation rights under international law.    |\n| Conduct active radar sweeps        | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive measure; does not constitute a use of force.                   |\n| Issue radio challenge to Red units | AUTHORIZED    | Non-escalatory communication to clarify intent and assert navigation.    |\n| Deploy small UAV for overwatch     | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive surveillance in response to increased Red activity.            |\n| Alter course to avoid Red units    | RESTRICTED    | Legal but may undermine freedom of navigation assertion.                 |\n| Conduct live-fire gunnery exercise | PROHIBITED    | Inconsistent with peacetime ROE; no hostile act/intent detected.         |\n| Use non-lethal means (e.g., LRAD)  | RESTRICTED    | Legal but could escalate tensions; requires clear justification.         |\n| Release counter-narrative in media | AUTHORIZED    | Non-kinetic response to disinformation aligns with strategic communication. |\n\n**ROE CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:** NO — Red's disinformation campaign, while provocative in the information domain, does not constitute a hostile act or hostile intent under international law.  \n\n**KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- Disinformation campaigns fall outside the scope of traditional ROE but can have significant strategic implications. Blue should focus on countering such narratives through lawful and transparent communication.  \n- Blue's operational actions remain governed by peacetime ROE, as no physical threat or interference has occurred that would justify escalation.\n---------- TextMessage (Blue_Planner) ----------\n**BLUE ACTION — Turn 3**\n\nACTION: public_affairs_statement\n\n- **Selected action:** public_affairs_statement\n\n- **Reasoning:** Red's disinformation campaign directly targets the information domain, seeking to undermine Blue's legitimacy and sway international opinion. A pre-cleared public affairs statement documenting the lawful nature of Blue's freedom of navigation operation, along with evidence of Red's provocations (e.g., militia deployment), is the most effective countermeasure. This action reinforces Blue's narrative of adherence to international law and transparency, while exposing Red's disinformation efforts.\n\n- **Tradeoffs considered:** Alternatives such as maintaining course and speed (shadow_and_monitor) or deploying a UAV for overwatch (reposition_isr) were considered but do not directly address the information domain challenge posed by Red's disinformation. More aggressive actions, such as active radar sweeps or non-lethal measures, were deemed unnecessary and potentially escalatory given the lack of physical interference.\n\n- **Expected effect:** This action will bolster Blue's credibility in the international arena, countering Red's disinformation and reinforcing the narrative of lawful navigation. It also supports long-term strategic communication goals by documenting Red's behavior and demonstrating Blue's commitment to transparency and international norms.\n---------- TextMessage (White_Cell) ----------\n**WHITE CELL ADJUDICATION — Turn 3**\n\n**DTG:** T+0014H  \n\n**Actions this turn:**  \n- Red: **disinformation_release** — Red launches a coordinated disinformation campaign through state-controlled media and social media platforms, accusing Blue of provocative and aggressive actions in the contested waters. The campaign includes fabricated images and narratives designed to portray Red as defending its sovereignty against foreign intrusion.  \n- Blue: **public_affairs_statement** — Blue responds with a pre-cleared public affairs statement emphasizing the lawful nature of its freedom of navigation operation. The statement includes evidence of Red's militia deployment and highlights Blue's adherence to international law, countering Red's disinformation with transparency and factual documentation.  \n\n**INTERACTION RESOLUTION:**  \nRed's disinformation campaign gains some traction in domestic and sympathetic international media but is quickly challenged by Blue's public affairs statement. Blue's release of verifiable evidence, including imagery of Red's militia deployment, undermines the credibility of Red's claims. While the disinformation campaign creates some initial confusion, Blue's proactive communication strategy limits its impact and reinforces its narrative of lawful navigation. The information environment remains contested but tilts slightly in Blue's favor.  \n\n**ESCALATION UPDATE:**  \n- Previous index: 1  \n- Change: [+1] (Red: [+1], Blue: [+0])  \n- New index: 2 → **ROUTINE**  \n\n**THRESHOLD CROSSING:** NO — The escalation level remains at \"ROUTINE,\" with the primary activity confined to the information domain.  \n\n**SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:**  \n- Weather: Conditions remain favorable, with clear skies and calm seas. Visibility continues to support monitoring and documentation efforts.  \n- Time of day: Mid-afternoon, with strong sunlight aiding imagery and video capture for both sides.  \n- Nearby shipping: No additional civilian vessels detected in the area, reducing the risk of collateral involvement.  \n- Media attention: The disinformation campaign and Blue's counterstatement have drawn increased attention from regional and international media outlets. Independent analysts are beginning to scrutinize Red's claims, with some outlets highlighting inconsistencies in the disinformation campaign.  \n\nThe information domain becomes the primary battleground this turn, with both sides leveraging strategic communication to shape perceptions. Blue's measured and transparent response successfully counters Red's disinformation, maintaining the operational and narrative initiative.\n---------- TextMessage (StratComm) ----------\n**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS — Turn 3**  \n\n**BLUE PUBLIC STATEMENT (DRAFT):**  \n\"The BNS Resolute continues its lawful freedom of navigation operation in international waters, in full compliance with international law. Recent claims by certain parties attempting to portray this mission as provocative are baseless and contradicted by clear evidence, including the deployment of irregular militia vessels to impede safe passage. We remain committed to transparency and the principles of a free and open maritime domain.\"  \n\n**PREDICTED ADVERSARY RESPONSE:**  \nRed will likely double down on its disinformation campaign, amplifying fabricated narratives and selectively releasing misleading or doctored imagery to support its claims. Red state media may accuse Blue of \"escalating tensions\" by publicizing the militia deployment, framing it as an overreaction. Social media channels aligned with Red may attempt to discredit Blue's evidence by questioning its authenticity or claiming it is staged.  \n\n**INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Blue narrative strength: **STRONG** — Blue's release of verifiable evidence and adherence to international law strengthens its credibility and undermines Red's disinformation campaign.  \n- Red narrative strength: **MODERATE** — While Red's disinformation initially gained traction, its credibility has been eroded by Blue's transparent and factual counter-narrative. However, Red's domestic audience and sympathetic regional actors may still accept its framing.  \n- Key narrative battleground: **Credibility and transparency vs. sovereignty defense** — The focus is now on which side can maintain the trust of the international community and demonstrate legitimacy in their actions and claims.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \nBlue should sustain its proactive communication strategy by continuing to release verifiable evidence that highlights Red's provocations and underscores Blue's lawful and professional conduct. Engage with independent analysts and international maritime organizations to validate Blue's claims and further discredit Red's disinformation. Additionally, consider leveraging social media platforms to amplify Blue's narrative, targeting both regional and global audiences to maximize reach and impact.\n"

Spoofing AIS (Automatic Identification System) signals to broadcast false vessel identities or positions introduces confusion into Blue's situational awareness. This action is subtle, non-kinetic, and deniable, making it appropriate for the current \"ROUTINE\" escalation level under peacetime ROE.\n\n- **Intended effect:** Red aims to degrade Blue's ability to maintain a clear operational picture, potentially causing delays or missteps in its freedom of navigation mission. This also serves as a signal of Red's technological capability and willingness to contest Blue's presence in the contested waters.\n\n- **Risk accepted:** If Blue detects the spoofing and attributes it to Red, it could lead to reputational damage or bolster Blue's justification for its mission. Additionally, this action may have limited immediate impact on Blue's operations if they quickly identify and mitigate the spoofing.\n---------- TextMessage (Legal_ROE) ----------\n**LEGAL/ROE ASSESSMENT — Turn 4**\n\n**Current ROE:** PEACETIME  \n**Escalation:** 1 (ROUTINE)  \n\n| Blue Action                        | Legal Status  | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain course and speed          | AUTHORIZED    | Consistent with freedom of navigation rights under international law.    |\n| Conduct active radar sweeps        | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive measure; does not constitute a use of force.                   |\n| Issue radio challenge to Red units | AUTHORIZED    | Non-escalatory communication to clarify intent and assert navigation.    |\n| Deploy small UAV for overwatch     | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive surveillance in response to potential electronic interference. |\n| Alter course to avoid Red units    | RESTRICTED    | Legal but may undermine freedom of navigation assertion.                 |\n| Conduct live-fire gunnery exercise | PROHIBITED    | Inconsistent with peacetime ROE; no hostile act/intent detected.         |\n| Use non-lethal means (e.g., LRAD)  | RESTRICTED    | Legal but could escalate tensions; requires clear justification.         |\n| Investigate AIS anomalies          | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive action to restore situational awareness; non-escalatory.       |\n\n**ROE CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:** NO — AIS spoofing, while disruptive, does not meet the threshold of a hostile act or hostile intent under international law.  \n\n**KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- AIS spoofing is a form of electronic interference that complicates navigation but does not constitute a direct threat to Blue's vessel or personnel. It remains below the threshold for a change in ROE.  \n- Blue should focus on documenting and mitigating the spoofing while maintaining its operational objectives. Attribution of the spoofing to Red must be handled carefully to avoid premature escalation.\n---------- TextMessage (Blue_Planner) ----------\n**BLUE ACTION — Turn 4**\n\nACTION: reposition_isr\n\n- **Selected action:** reposition_isr\n\n- **Reasoning:** Red's AIS spoofing introduces potential confusion into Blue's situational awareness, which could jeopardize the freedom of navigation mission. Redirecting ISR assets, such as patrol aircraft or UAVs, to obtain better coverage of the area will help Blue verify vessel identities and positions, mitigating the effects of the spoofing. This action is defensive, non-escalatory, and ensures Blue maintains operational control.\n\n- **Tradeoffs considered:** Maintaining course and speed (shadow_and_monitor) was considered but does not address the immediate need to counter the spoofing. Investigating AIS anomalies was also an option but would be less effective without enhanced ISR coverage. More aggressive actions, such as active radar sweeps or non-lethal measures, were rejected as unnecessary escalations given the current low threat level.\n\n- **Expected effect:** This action will restore Blue's situational awareness, enabling the BNS Resolute to continue its mission with confidence. It also demonstrates Blue's technological capability and resolve to counter Red's interference, reinforcing Blue's operational and strategic objectives.\n---------- TextMessage (White_Cell) ----------\n**WHITE CELL ADJUDICATION — Turn 4**\n\n**DTG:** T+0016H  \n\n**Actions this turn:**  \n- Red: **ais_spoofing** — Red initiates AIS spoofing, broadcasting false signals that create phantom vessels and misrepresent the positions of real vessels in the contested waters. This action aims to degrade Blue's situational awareness and complicate its operational picture.  \n- Blue: **reposition_isr** — Blue redirects ISR assets, including a UAV and a maritime patrol aircraft, to enhance coverage of the area. These assets focus on verifying vessel identities and positions, countering the effects of the AIS spoofing and restoring situational awareness.  \n\n**INTERACTION RESOLUTION:**  \nRed's AIS spoofing initially creates confusion in Blue's operational picture, with phantom vessels appearing on navigational displays. However, Blue's repositioned ISR assets quickly identify the spoofing activity and confirm the actual positions of vessels in the area. The spoofing is mitigated before it can significantly impact Blue's freedom of navigation mission. While Red demonstrates its electronic warfare capabilities, Blue's prompt response reinforces its operational control and technological resilience.  \n\n**ESCALATION UPDATE:**  \n- Previous index: 2  \n- Change: [+1] (Red: [+1], Blue: [+0])  \n- New index: 3 → **PROVOCATION**  \n\n**THRESHOLD CROSSING:** YES — The escalation index crosses into **PROVOCATION** (Level 2). This marks a shift in the situation, as Red's AIS spoofing represents a more deliberate effort to interfere with Blue's operations, prompting a more active response from Blue.  \n\n**SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:**  \n- Weather: Conditions remain stable, with clear skies and calm seas. Visibility supports ISR operations and vessel identification.  \n- Time of day: Late afternoon, with sufficient daylight for ISR assets to operate effectively.  \n- Nearby shipping: A small fishing vessel enters the area, but its AIS signal matches its observed position, confirming it is not part of the spoofing activity.  \n- Media attention: Reports of electronic interference in the contested waters begin to circulate in regional media, with speculation about Red's involvement. Blue's ISR response is not publicly disclosed but is documented for potential future use in strategic communications.  \n\nThe escalation to \"PROVOCATION\" reflects the increasing complexity of the situation, as Red's actions shift from passive monitoring to active interference. Blue's measured and effective response maintains operational momentum while avoiding unnecessary escalation.\n---------- TextMessage (StratComm) ----------\n**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS — Turn 4**  \n\n**BLUE PUBLIC STATEMENT (DRAFT):**  \n\"The BNS Resolute continues its lawful freedom of navigation operation in international waters, despite attempts to disrupt maritime safety through electronic interference. We remain committed to transparency and upholding international law, ensuring the free and open use of the seas for all nations.\"  \n\n**PREDICTED ADVERSARY RESPONSE:**  \nRed is likely to deny involvement in the AIS spoofing and may accuse Blue of fabricating claims to justify its presence in contested waters. Red state media could frame the spoofing reports as \"unsubstantiated allegations\" and shift focus to portraying Blue's ISR activities as intrusive or escalatory. Social media narratives may attempt to downplay the spoofing or redirect attention to unrelated issues, such as historical grievances or broader geopolitical tensions.  \n\n**INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Blue narrative strength: **STRONG** — Blue's prompt and effective response to the spoofing reinforces its credibility and operational competence. The emphasis on transparency and adherence to international law continues to resonate with international audiences.  \n- Red narrative strength: **MODERATE** — While Red's AIS spoofing demonstrates technological capability, its deniability limits its ability to leverage the action in the information domain. The lack of credible counter-narratives weakens its position.  \n- Key narrative battleground: **Maritime safety and operational legitimacy** — The focus is on whether Red's actions undermine maritime safety and whether Blue's response is proportionate and justified.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \nBlue should prepare to release evidence of the AIS spoofing, such as radar data or ISR imagery, to further discredit Red's actions and reinforce its narrative of transparency and professionalism. Engage with international maritime organizations to highlight the risks posed by electronic interference to global shipping and maritime safety. This approach not only counters Red's denials but also broadens the narrative to emphasize the importance of maintaining a rules-based maritime order.\n"

Conducting an unsafe intercept, closing to a dangerously close point of approach (CPA < 100 yards), signals Red's resolve to deny access and assert territorial claims. This action is provocative but stops short of outright aggression, remaining within the bounds of peacetime ROE.\n\n- **Intended effect:** Red aims to force Blue into a defensive posture, potentially disrupting its mission and creating an opportunity for Blue to reconsider its course of action. This also serves as a strong signal to domestic and international audiences of Red's commitment to defending its claimed waters.\n\n- **Risk accepted:** There is a significant risk of miscalculation or collision, which could escalate the situation beyond Red's intent. Additionally, this action may provide Blue with justification for stronger responses, including public condemnation or operational countermeasures.\n---------- TextMessage (Legal_ROE) ----------\n**LEGAL/ROE ASSESSMENT — Turn 5**\n\n**Current ROE:** PEACETIME  \n**Escalation:** 2 (ROUTINE)  \n\n| Blue Action                        | Legal Status  | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain course and speed          | AUTHORIZED    | Consistent with freedom of navigation rights under international law.    |\n| Conduct active radar sweeps        | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive measure; does not constitute a use of force.                   |\n| Issue radio challenge to Red units | AUTHORIZED    | Non-escalatory communication to clarify intent and assert navigation.    |\n| Deploy small UAV for overwatch     | AUTHORIZED    | Defensive surveillance in response to unsafe intercept.                  |\n| Alter course to avoid Red units    | RESTRICTED    | Legal but may undermine freedom of navigation assertion.                 |\n| Conduct live-fire gunnery exercise | PROHIBITED    | Inconsistent with peacetime ROE; no hostile act/intent detected.         |\n| Use non-lethal means (e.g., LRAD)  | RESTRICTED    | Legal but could escalate tensions; requires clear justification.         |\n| Withdraw to de-escalate            | AUTHORIZED    | Aligns with commander override and avoids further escalation.            |\n\n**ROE CHANGE RECOMMENDATION:** NO — While the unsafe intercept is provocative and increases the risk of collision, it does not meet the threshold of a hostile act or hostile intent under international law.  \n\n**KEY LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- Unsafe intercepts violate navigational safety norms under COLREGS (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) but do not justify a shift in ROE unless they result in a direct threat to Blue's vessel or personnel.  \n- Blue's mandated withdrawal to de-escalate is legally sound and strategically prudent, as it avoids unnecessary escalation while documenting Red's unsafe actions for future diplomatic leverage.\n---------- TextMessage (Blue_Planner) ----------\n**BLUE ACTION — Turn 5**\n\nACTION: withdraw_to_deescalate\n\n- **Selected action:** withdraw_to_deescalate\n\n- **Reasoning:** The commander’s override mandates a controlled withdrawal to de-escalate the situation. Red's unsafe intercept significantly increases the risk of collision or miscalculation, making this action the safest and most prudent response. By withdrawing while maintaining surveillance, Blue signals non-aggression and avoids further escalation, consistent with peacetime ROE and international law.\n\n- **Tradeoffs considered:** While maintaining course and speed or issuing a radio challenge could assert Blue's navigational rights, these actions risk further escalation given the unsafe proximity of Red's vessels. Deploying a UAV for overwatch was considered but would not directly address the immediate risk posed by the unsafe intercept. More aggressive actions, such as active radar sweeps or non-lethal measures, were rejected as unnecessarily provocative under the current circumstances.\n\n- **Expected effect:** This action will reduce the immediate risk of collision and demonstrate Blue's commitment to de-escalation while documenting Red's unsafe behavior for future use in strategic communications and legal forums. It preserves Blue's credibility as a responsible actor in the contested waters.\n---------- TextMessage (White_Cell) ----------\n**WHITE CELL ADJUDICATION — Turn 5**\n\n**DTG:** T+0018H  \n\n**Actions this turn:**  \n- Red: **unsafe_intercept** — Red conducts an unsafe intercept, closing to within 100 yards of BNS Resolute. The maneuver is aggressive and creates a high-risk situation, forcing Blue to take immediate action to avoid a potential collision.  \n- Blue: **withdraw_to_deescalate** — In response to the unsafe intercept, BNS Resolute executes a controlled withdrawal from the immediate area, maintaining surveillance and documenting Red's actions while avoiding further escalation.  \n\n**INTERACTION RESOLUTION:**  \nRed's unsafe intercept creates a tense and dangerous situation, with the potential for miscalculation or collision. Blue's decision to withdraw reduces the immediate risk and avoids a direct confrontation. The withdrawal is executed in a deliberate and professional manner, ensuring that Blue maintains situational awareness and collects evidence of Red's provocative behavior. Red achieves a temporary tactical advantage by asserting dominance in the contested waters, but Blue's measured response preserves its strategic credibility and avoids unnecessary escalation.  \n\n**ESCALATION UPDATE:**  \n- Previous index: 3  \n- Change: [+2] (Red: [+2], Blue: [+0])  \n- New index: 5 → **CONFRONTATION**  \n\n**THRESHOLD CROSSING:** YES — The escalation index crosses into **CONFRONTATION** (Level 3). This reflects the significant increase in tension and risk resulting from Red's unsafe intercept and the need for Blue to take active measures to de-escalate.  \n\n**SITUATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS:**  \n- Weather: Conditions remain favorable, with clear skies and calm seas. Visibility supports surveillance and documentation efforts.  \n- Time of day: Early evening, with sufficient light for visual monitoring but approaching dusk.  \n- Nearby shipping: No additional civilian vessels detected in the area, minimizing the risk of collateral involvement.  \n- Media attention: Reports of the unsafe intercept begin to surface in regional media, with speculation about the potential for escalation. Blue's withdrawal is not immediately publicized but is documented for potential use in strategic communications.  \n\nThe escalation to \"CONFRONTATION\" marks a critical juncture in the standoff, with Red's actions pushing the situation toward a more dangerous and unpredictable phase. Blue's controlled withdrawal mitigates the immediate risk while preserving its ability to respond strategically in the information and diplomatic domains.\n---------- TextMessage (StratComm) ----------\n**STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS — Turn 5**  \n\n**BLUE PUBLIC STATEMENT (DRAFT):**  \n\"The BNS Resolute has completed its freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law, despite unsafe and provocative actions by other parties in the region. These reckless maneuvers endangered maritime safety and violated established norms of conduct at sea. We remain committed to upholding the principles of a free and open maritime domain and will continue to document and address such actions through appropriate channels.\"  \n\n**PREDICTED ADVERSARY RESPONSE:**  \nRed will likely frame Blue's withdrawal as a victory, portraying it as a retreat in the face of Red's resolve to defend its territorial claims. State media may emphasize Red's \"firm but measured\" actions, downplaying the unsafe intercept while highlighting Blue's departure as evidence of its inability to challenge Red's dominance. Social media narratives may amplify this framing, with claims of Red's sovereignty being upheld against foreign interference.  \n\n**INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Blue narrative strength: **MODERATE** — Blue's emphasis on professionalism, adherence to international law, and documentation of Red's unsafe actions bolsters its credibility, but the withdrawal may be perceived as a loss of momentum or resolve by some audiences.  \n- Red narrative strength: **STRONG** — Red's ability to frame Blue's withdrawal as a tactical victory resonates with domestic and sympathetic regional audiences, reinforcing its narrative of territorial defense.  \n- Key narrative battleground: **Perception of strength vs. adherence to norms** — The focus is on whether Blue's withdrawal is seen as a responsible de-escalation or a concession, and whether Red's actions are viewed as assertive or reckless.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**  \nBlue should immediately release evidence of Red's unsafe intercept, such as video footage or radar data, to highlight the reckless and provocative nature of Red's actions. Frame the withdrawal as a calculated and responsible decision to prioritize maritime safety and de-escalation, underscoring Blue's commitment to international norms. Engage with international maritime organizations and allied nations to amplify this narrative and call for accountability for Red's behavior. This approach shifts the focus from tactical outcomes to strategic principles, reinforcing Blue's long-term objectives in the region.\n"
