    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Given a completed game log (from Demo 2 or a hand-crafted transcript), a team of agents automatically reconstructs the decision timeline, identifies pivotal turning points, evaluates each key decision against doctrinal references, and produces a structured AAR report with \"lessons observed.\" The user then drives an interactive interrogation — selecting decision points, asking \"what if?\", and watching agents generate counterfactual branches on the spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Researchers, exercise designers, training professionals, and those exploring AI-assisted analysis in synthetic wargaming environments.\n",
    "**Primary outcome:** A structured AAR report (Observation → Discussion → Recommendation → Training Implication) produced by cooperating agents, with interactive counterfactual exploration driven by a human-in-the-loop facilitator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Responsible AI & Scope Statement:** This research explores human-AI collaboration and explainable decision-support in fully synthetic, abstract environments. All scenarios, agents, and data are artificially generated. No real-world operational data, contingency plans, systems, or intelligence are used or represented. The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority. Doctrinal references are inspired by publicly available concepts and do not represent authoritative U.S. Navy doctrine."

    "| **Azure Identity (`DefaultAzureCredential`)** | Provides a credential chain that works transparently in multiple environments — Managed Identity in Azure, `az login` locally, or environment variables in CI/CD — so no secret material ever appears in code. | [Azure Identity client library](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme) |\n",

    "\n",
    "Each agent below is an [`AssistantAgent`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/agents/assistant_agent/) — a lightweight wrapper that pairs a **system prompt** (describing the agent's persona and task) with a **model client** (the `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` created above). When an agent is asked to run, the flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AutoGen combines the agent's system prompt with the user task message.\n",
    "2. The combined prompt is sent to the Azure AI Foundry endpoint via the [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/overview).\n",
    "3. The model returns a completion, which AutoGen routes to the next agent in the pipeline or displays to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all agents share the same `model_client`, they all call the same Azure-hosted model — but each behaves differently based on its system prompt. The [`RoundRobinGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/agentchat/teams/round_robin_group_chat/) used later orchestrates agents by passing each agent's output as context to the next agent in sequence.\n",

    "The AAR runs in five phases: **Replay &rarr; Critique &rarr; Counterfactual &rarr; Compile &rarr; Explainability**. Each phase pipes its output to the next, building toward a comprehensive lessons-learned document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens under the hood at each phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Every phase follows the same Azure interaction pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build a prompt** — The utility function `format_game_log_for_prompt()` converts the structured JSON game log into a text summary the model can consume. Each phase also appends outputs from earlier phases so context accumulates.\n",
    "2. **Call the model** — `agent.run_stream(task=...)` sends the prompt to the Azure AI Foundry endpoint via the [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/overview). The `Console` wrapper streams tokens to the notebook in real time.\n",
    "3. **Accumulate results** — Each agent's output is stored in the `aar_results` dictionary and fed forward into subsequent phases, creating a chain-of-analysis rather than isolated outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Cost awareness:** Each phase makes one or more LLM calls to your Azure AI Foundry deployment. Monitor token usage and costs in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) under your AI Foundry resource. See [Azure AI Foundry pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-foundry/) for details."

      "\n",
      "- **Potential risks of this alternative:**  \n",
      "  - Red might have interpreted Blue's maneuver as a sign of weakness, potentially emboldening further provocations.  \n",

      "  - A deliberate maneuver to increase separation would be consistent with COLREGS Rule 8, which emphasizes the responsibility to avoid collision through positive and timely action.  \n",
      "  - Blue's documentation of the incident would provide evidence of its professionalism and Red's unsafe behavior, reinforcing its narrative in the information domain.  \n",

      "#### **Why Turn 3 Stands Out**\n",
      "Turn 3 was a pivotal moment where the confrontation shifted from the information domain to physical provocation. Blue's decision to maintain course and speed avoided immediate escalation but left the BNS Resolute vulnerable to further unsafe maneuvers by Red. A deliberate maneuver to increase separation could have de-escalated the physical risk while maintaining Blue's deterrent posture and narrative control.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Actionable Insight**\n",
      "Blue's response in Turn 3 highlights the need for doctrine to address proportional responses to unsafe intercepts in contested waters. In future scenarios, Blue could consider the following:\n",
      "1. **Incorporate deliberate de-escalatory maneuvers:** Doctrine should emphasize the importance of maneuvering to reduce physical risk while maintaining mission objectives and documenting adversary provocations.  \n",
      "2. **Leverage COLREGS for narrative advantage:** Actions consistent with international maritime law can reinforce Blue's narrative of professionalism and adherence to norms, even in the face of adversary provocations.  \n",
      "3. **Balance deterrence and restraint:** Blue should aim to project strength through measured responses that prioritize safety and deny adversaries opportunities to escalate further.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Turn 3 presented a clear opportunity for Blue to de-escalate the physical risk posed by Red's *Unsafe Intercept* without ceding the narrative or compromising its deterrent posture. A deliberate maneuver to increase separation would have aligned with doctrinal principles and reinforced Blue's strategic objectives.\n"

       "**RECOMMENDATION:** Update doctrine to provide specific guidance on proportional responses to unsafe intercepts, including maneuvers to ensure safety while maintaining mission objectives.  \n",
       "**IMPLICATION FOR TRAINING:** Incorporate scenarios involving unsafe intercepts into naval exercises, emphasizing decision-making under uncertainty and the execution of proportional responses to maintain safety and operational objectives.\n",

       "\n",
       "## Lesson 2: Countering Disinformation in the Information Domain (Turn 4)\n",
       "**OBSERVATION:** Red launched a coordinated disinformation campaign accusing Blue of unsafe navigation, using doctored evidence to shape the narrative. Blue countered with a public affairs statement backed by documented evidence, reinforcing its adherence to international law.  \n",
       "**DISCUSSION:** The confrontation shifted decisively into the information domain, where the stakes extended beyond the immediate standoff to global perceptions of legitimacy and professionalism. Blue's evidence-based response mitigated Red's disinformation campaign, but the narrative contest remained unresolved. This turn demonstrated the importance of rapid, documented responses to adversary disinformation.  \n",
       "**RECOMMENDATION:** Doctrine should emphasize the importance of pre-cleared public affairs statements, rapid evidence collection, and coordination with allies to counter adversary disinformation campaigns effectively.  \n",

       "**OBSERVATION:** Blue executed a controlled withdrawal from the contested waters, reducing the risk of further escalation while documenting Red's actions for future diplomatic leverage.  \n",
       "**DISCUSSION:** The withdrawal de-escalated the situation, preventing a potential crisis. However, Red's continued shadowing reinforced its sovereignty claims, leaving the strategic contest unresolved. While doctrine supports de-escalatory actions, the framing of such actions is critical to avoid perceptions of concession. Strategic communication must accompany de-escalatory measures to reinforce Blue's professionalism and resolve.  \n",
       "**RECOMMENDATION:** Doctrine should emphasize the importance of framing de-escalatory actions through coordinated strategic communication to avoid perceptions of concession and reinforce mission objectives.  \n",

       "## Lesson 4: Repositioning ISR Assets to Counter Deception (Turn 2)\n",
       "**OBSERVATION:** Red broadcasted false AIS signals, creating phantom vessels to confuse Blue's situational awareness. Blue redirected ISR assets to counter Red's deception and improve contact identification.  \n",
       "**DISCUSSION:** Red's AIS spoofing was a sophisticated information warfare tactic designed to degrade Blue's operational awareness. Blue's decision to reposition ISR assets neutralized this tactic, preserving its operational picture and enabling it to document Red's deceptive actions. This demonstrated the importance of ISR integration in countering adversary deception tactics.  \n",
       "**RECOMMENDATION:** Doctrine should continue to emphasize the integration of ISR assets in countering adversary deception tactics, particularly in gray-zone scenarios.  \n",
       "**IMPLICATION FOR TRAINING:** Incorporate deception tactics such as AIS spoofing into training scenarios, requiring participants to use ISR assets to maintain situational awareness and counter adversary actions.\n",

       "**OBSERVATION:** Red deployed a maritime militia swarm to obstruct Blue's freedom of navigation transit. Blue responded with bridge-to-bridge warnings, reinforcing international law and documenting Red's obstruction.  \n",
       "**DISCUSSION:** Red's low-risk, high-impact maneuver set the tone for the standoff, forcing Blue to respond while maintaining plausible deniability. Blue's professional response reinforced its narrative of adherence to international law while documenting Red's actions for future legal and diplomatic leverage. This demonstrated the importance of early documentation and professional engagement in gray-zone operations.  \n",
       "**RECOMMENDATION:** Doctrine should continue to emphasize the importance of early documentation and professional engagement in response to adversary gray-zone tactics.  \n",
