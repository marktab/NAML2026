Each cycle produces a structured SITREP explaining *what* the current situation is and *how and why* it changed.\n",

        "This cell builds an [Azure AI Inference](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-inference-readme) model client that connects to your Azure AI Foundry endpoint. AutoGen 0.7 uses explicit `model_client` objects — each agent shares the same client, so all LLM calls go through a single, centrally configured connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reads environment variables** — `AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` (populated earlier by the Key Vault bootstrap in `common/config.py`, or from your `.env` file).\n",
        "2. **Creates an `AzureAIChatCompletionClient`** — this is AutoGen's wrapper around the [Azure AI Inference SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-inference-readme). It uses [`AzureKeyCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-core/azure.core.credentials.azurekeycredential) to authenticate each API call.\n",
        "3. **Configures model capabilities** — the `model_info` dict tells AutoGen what the model supports (JSON output, multiple system messages, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Key concept — `model_client` pattern:** In AutoGen 0.7, agents don't manage their own LLM connections. Instead, you create a `model_client` once and pass it to every agent. This makes it easy to swap models (e.g., switch from `gpt-4o` to `Phi-4`) by changing a single variable.\n",

Each agent's prompt defines its role, output format, and decision rules — all visible and auditable.\n",

        "**How AutoGen agents work:**\n",
        "\n",
        "An `AssistantAgent` is the core building block in AutoGen 0.7. You create one by providing:\n",
        "- **`name`** — A unique identifier used in message headers (e.g., `\"Scenario_Orchestrator\"`)\n",
        "- **`system_message`** — A detailed prompt that defines the agent's persona, responsibilities, output format, and guardrails\n",
        "- **`model_client`** — The LLM connection (here, our `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` pointing to Azure AI Foundry)\n",
        "\n",
        "When the agent receives a message, it sends the full conversation history plus its system prompt to the LLM and returns the response. The system prompt is where all the \"intelligence\" lives — the LLM itself is general-purpose; the prompt makes it a specialist.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Design pattern:** All four agents share the **same** `model_client` (same LLM, same endpoint). Their behavior differs entirely because of their system prompts. This is a core AutoGen pattern: **one model, many specialized agents**.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each turn runs a [`RoundRobinGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) — AutoGen 0.7's simplest team pattern. The agents speak in a fixed order:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Orchestrator → ISR Fusion → Assessment → Briefer\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works step-by-step:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `run_turn()` function builds a **turn prompt** containing the current world-state JSON and new intelligence reports.\n",
        "2. A new `RoundRobinGroupChat` is created with the four agents and a [`MaxMessageTermination(4)`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.conditions.html) — meaning the chat ends after 4 messages (one per agent).\n",
        "3. [`team.run_stream(task=turn_prompt)`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html) sends the prompt as the first user message and starts the round-robin. Each agent sees **all previous messages** in the conversation, so the Briefer sees the Orchestrator's updates, ISR's fusion, and Assessment's ratings.\n",
        "4. [`Console(...)`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.ui.html) streams each agent's response to the notebook output in real time — you can watch the agents \"think\" sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Why `RoundRobinGroupChat`?** It's deterministic and debuggable — you know exactly which agent speaks when. AutoGen also offers [`SelectorGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) (an LLM picks the next speaker) and [`Swarm`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm) (agents hand off using tool calls) for more dynamic patterns.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Azure connection:** Every agent message triggers an API call to your [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-ai-foundry) endpoint via the shared `model_client`. With 4 agents per turn and 3 turns, the demo makes ~12 LLM calls total.\n",

AIS inconsistencies suggest possible maritime militia or auxiliary vessels.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** Likely involved in area denial or gray-zone operations, given social media reports of warnings to local fishers.\n\n3. **RED: Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel**  \n   - **Status Update (CONFIRMED):** Social media imagery confirms presence near Cerulean Shoal. Likely involved in warning local vessels and enforcing an exclusion zone.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** Enforcing claimed maritime zone closure for \"exercises.\"  \n\n### NEW EVENTS\n1. **T0+0030H:** SIGINT intercept detected on Red Fleet tactical net. Bearing 330 from BNS Resolute, signal strength moderate. Content encrypted but consistent with surface combatant position reporting.  \n2. **T0+0030H:** UAV Kite-31 imagery confirms fishing fleet growth to ~60 vessels. Three non-fishing hull forms identified at fleet periphery. AIS inconsistencies noted.  \n3. **T0+0035H:** Social media posts from local fishers report warnings from gray-hulled vessels near Cerulean Shoal. Photos confirm presence of a large Red coast guard cutter.\n\n### RESOLVED UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **Fishing fleet composition unverified:** Resolved to include three non-fishing hull forms likely associated with maritime militia or auxiliary forces.  \n\n### NEW UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **RNS Frigate Alpha exact position:** SIGINT suggests presence near Grid AA-09, but precise location remains unconfirmed.  \n2. **Fishing fleet mission:** Presence of non-fishing hull forms and exclusion zone enforcement raises questions about coordination with Red military forces.  \n3. **Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel ROE posture:** Social media reports suggest active enforcement, but exact rules of engagement remain unclear.  \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAY\nThe situation is escalating with the confirmed presence of non-fishing vessels in the fishing fleet, enforcement of an exclusion zone by Red forces, and the likely proximity of a Red frigate.\n---------- TextMessage (ISR_Intel_Fusion) ----------\n**INTELLIGENCE FUSION SUMMARY — Turn 1**\n\nCONFIRMED (multi-source corroboration):\n• Fishing fleet size increased to ~60 vessels, with three non-fishing hull forms (gray paint, no visible fishing gear) at the periphery — Sources: UAV Kite-31 (imagery), OSINT (social media).  \n• Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel enforcing an exclusion zone near Cerulean Shoal, warning local fishers away — Sources: OSINT (social media), UAV Kite-31 (imagery).  \n\nPROBABLE (single reliable source, consistent with pattern):\n• RNS Frigate Alpha likely located near Grid AA-09 based on SIGINT intercept (bearing 330 from BNS Resolute, signal strength moderate, encrypted) — Source: SIGINT (A-3).  \n• Fishing fleet includes maritime militia or auxiliary vessels, given AIS inconsistencies and hull forms — Source: UAV Kite-31 (A-2).  \n\nPOSSIBLE (unconfirmed / single source / partially contradicted):\n• Red forces may be conducting coordinated area denial operations under the guise of \"exercises\" — Source: OSINT (social media), Caveat: No direct confirmation of coordination between Red naval and coast guard assets.  \n\nCONTRADICTIONS REQUIRING RESOLUTION:\n• None identified this cycle.  \n\nINFORMATION GAPS (prioritized):\n1. Precise location and intent of RNS Frigate Alpha.  \n2. Command-and-control links between fishing fleet (maritime militia) and Red naval/coast guard forces.  \n3. Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel's rules of engagement (ROE) and escalation thresholds.  \n\nCOLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS:\n• Task UAV Kite-31 to conduct a focused ISR sweep of Grid AA-09 to locate and identify RNS Frigate Alpha.  \n• Task MPA Lookout-21 to monitor fishing fleet activity and identify command-and-control patterns (e.g., radio transmissions, movement coordination).  \n• Initiate SIGINT efforts to decrypt Red Fleet tactical net communications for insight into intent and coordination.  \n• Exploit OSINT further for additional local reports or imagery of Red forces' activities near Cerulean Shoal.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe situation is trending toward increased tension, with evidence of Red forces employing gray-zone tactics. The presence of non-fishing vessels in the fleet and exclusion zone enforcement suggest a deliberate posture to challenge Blue's freedom of navigation patrol. Immediate focus should be on confirming the frigate's location and understanding the adversary's intent and coordination mechanisms.\n---------- TextMessage (Assessment_Agent) ----------\n**ASSESSMENT UPDATE — Turn 1**\n\n| Assessment           | Previous   | Updated   | Δ         | Confidence | Key Evidence                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall Threat       | MODERATE   | ELEVATED  | ↑         | 0.45 → 0.65 | SIGINT suggests Red frigate nearby; fishing fleet includes non-fishing vessels; exclusion zone enforced. |\n| Escalation Risk      | LOW        | MODERATE  | ↑         | 0.5 → 0.6   | Red forces enforcing exclusion zone; maritime militia presence increases potential for miscalculation. |\n| Adversary Intent     | UNCERTAIN  | PROBABLE  | ↑         | 0.3 → 0.55  | Evidence of coordinated area denial operations (fishing fleet + coast guard cutter). |\n\nCHANGELOG:\n• **Overall Threat**: MODERATE → ELEVATED (conf 0.45 → 0.65)  \n  Driver: SIGINT indicates proximity of RNS Frigate Alpha, while UAV and OSINT confirm fishing fleet includes non-fishing vessels and exclusion zone enforcement.

New evidence, including SIGINT indicating the frigate's likely proximity, the confirmed presence of non-fishing vessels in the fishing fleet, and active exclusion zone enforcement, supports a higher threat level. These developments suggest a deliberate escalation in Red's posture, warranting an upgrade to ELEVATED.  \n\n2. **Escalation Risk**:  \n   Previously assessed as LOW due to the absence of hostile acts. The confirmed enforcement of an exclusion zone, coupled with the presence of maritime militia-like vessels, increases the likelihood of miscalculation or provocation. The risk of unintended incidents, such as collisions or confrontations, justifies raising the risk to MODERATE.  \n\n3. **Adversary Intent**:  \n   Previously assessed as UNCERTAIN due to insufficient intelligence. The combination of SIGINT (frigate position reporting), UAV imagery (non-fishing vessels in the fleet), and OSINT (exclusion zone enforcement) suggests a coordinated effort to deny Blue's freedom of navigation. While direct evidence of coordination between Red naval and coast guard forces is lacking, the pattern of activity makes it PROBABLE that Red is pursuing deliberate area denial operations.  \n\n---\n\n### WATCH ITEMS\n• **RNS Frigate Alpha**: Precise location remains unconfirmed; SIGINT suggests proximity to Grid AA-09.  \n• **Fishing Fleet Mission**: Non-fishing vessels at the fleet periphery suggest a potential maritime militia role.  \n• **Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel ROE**: Exclusion zone enforcement raises questions about escalation thresholds.  \n\n### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n1. **ISR Tasking**:  \n   - Redirect UAV Kite-31 to focus on Grid AA-09 for frigate identification.  \n   - Task MPA Lookout-21 to monitor fishing fleet activity and identify command-and-control patterns.  \n\n2. **SIGINT Efforts**:  \n   - Prioritize decryption of Red Fleet tactical net communications to clarify intent and coordination.  \n\n3. **OSINT Exploitation**:  \n   - Continue monitoring local social media for additional reports or imagery of Red activity near Cerulean Shoal.  \n\n4. **Force Posture**:  \n   - Consider adjusting BNS Resolute's patrol route to avoid direct confrontation while maintaining FON objectives.  \n\nThe situation is trending toward increased tension, with a clear need to confirm adversary intent and maintain situational awareness to prevent escalation.\n"

Characteristics include weapon canisters covered with tarps, concealed radomes, and false AIS transponder signals.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** Likely operating as part of a coordinated gray-zone operation, with FAC integrated into the fleet for area denial or potential harassment of foreign vessels.  \n\n### NEW EVENTS\n1. **T0+0035H:** HUMINT from Source CORAL-7 indicates Red coast guard vessels have orders to enforce exclusion zones and document foreign naval activity.  \n2. **T0+0040H:** SIGINT intercept places RNS Frigate Alpha on a southbound course, approximately 80-100nm from Resolute, with increasing signal strength.  \n3. **T0+0042H:** UAV Kite-31 imagery confirms three Red fast attack craft embedded within the fishing fleet. False AIS signals detected.  \n4. **T0+0045H:** ELINT from MPA Lookout-21 detects a brief surface-search radar emission from Grid AB-09, consistent with a Red frigate-class vessel.  \n\n### RESOLVED UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **Red Frigate Alpha exact position unknown:** Resolved to Grid AB-09 based on SIGINT and ELINT corroboration.  \n2. **Fishing fleet composition unverified:** Resolved to include three Red fast attack craft embedded within the fleet.  \n\n### NEW UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **Red fast attack craft intent:** While their presence is confirmed, their specific operational role (e.g., harassment, area denial, or potential engagement) remains unclear.  \n2. **Red Frigate Alpha mission:** While its position and course are now known, its specific intent (e.g., surveillance, support to exclusion zone, or deterrence) remains uncertain.  \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAY\nThe situation is escalating rapidly, with the confirmed presence of Red fast attack craft embedded in the fishing fleet, the southbound approach of RNS Frigate Alpha, and active exclusion zone enforcement by Red coast guard forces.\n---------- TextMessage (ISR_Intel_Fusion) ----------\n**INTELLIGENCE FUSION SUMMARY — Turn 2**\n\nCONFIRMED (multi-source corroboration):\n• RNS Frigate Alpha located in Grid AB-09, heading southbound toward the patrol area — Sources: SIGINT (bearing 315, increasing signal strength), ELINT (surface-search radar emission).  \n• Fishing fleet includes three Red fast attack craft (FAC) with weapon canisters covered by tarps, concealed radomes, and false AIS signals — Sources: UAV Kite-31 (imagery), ELINT (AIS anomalies).  \n• Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel enforcing exclusion zones and documenting foreign naval activity — Sources: HUMINT (CORAL-7), OSINT (social media).  \n\nPROBABLE (single reliable source, consistent with pattern):\n• Red fast attack craft are integrated into the fishing fleet for gray-zone operations, likely area denial or harassment — Source: UAV Kite-31 (A-2).  \n• RNS Frigate Alpha is conducting surveillance or preparing to support exclusion zone operations — Source: SIGINT (A-3).  \n\nPOSSIBLE (unconfirmed / single source / partially contradicted):\n• Red forces may be coordinating a layered area denial operation involving coast guard, frigate, and fast attack craft — Source: HUMINT (CORAL-7), Caveat: No direct evidence of coordination between assets.  \n\nCONTRADICTIONS REQUIRING RESOLUTION:\n• None identified this cycle.  \n\nINFORMATION GAPS (prioritized):\n1. Red fast attack craft operational intent (e.g., harassment, area denial, or potential engagement).  \n2. RNS Frigate Alpha's specific mission and rules of engagement.  \n3. Command-and-control links between Red naval, coast guard, and maritime militia forces.  \n\nCOLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS:\n• Task UAV Kite-31 to shadow the fishing fleet and monitor FAC activity for indications of intent (e.g., movement patterns, weapon readiness).  \n• Task MPA Lookout-21 to maintain ELINT coverage of RNS Frigate Alpha and monitor for radar or communication activity that indicates intent.  \n• Increase SIGINT efforts to decrypt Red tactical net communications for insight into coordination and intent.  \n• Exploit OSINT for additional local reports or imagery of Red forces' activities, particularly exclusion zone enforcement.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe situation is now HIGHLY DYNAMIC. The confirmed presence of Red fast attack craft within the fishing fleet and the southbound approach of RNS Frigate Alpha indicate a deliberate escalation of gray-zone tactics. The integration of multiple Red assets (frigate, coast guard, FAC) suggests a coordinated effort to challenge Blue's freedom of navigation patrol. Immediate focus should be on determining the intent and rules of engagement of Red forces to assess the likelihood of escalation to direct confrontation.\n---------- TextMessage (Assessment_Agent) ----------\n**ASSESSMENT UPDATE — Turn 2**\n\n| Assessment           | Previous   | Updated   | Δ         | Confidence | Key Evidence                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall Threat       | ELEVATED   | HIGH      | ↑         | 0.65 → 0.8 | Confirmed presence of Red FAC with weapon canisters in fishing fleet; RNS Frigate Alpha approaching patrol area. |\n| Escalation Risk      | MODERATE   | ELEVATED  | ↑         | 0.6 → 0.7   | Multiple Red assets (frigate, FAC, coast guard) operating in proximity, with exclusion zone enforcement. |\n| Adversary Intent     | PROBABLE   | LIKELY    | ↑         | 0.55 → 0.7  | Evidence of coordinated area denial involving Red naval and paramilitary forces. |\n\nCHANGELOG:\n• **Overall Threat**: ELEVATED → HIGH (conf 0.65 → 0.8)  \n  Driver: The confirmed presence of armed Red fast attack craft embedded in the fishing fleet, combined with the southbound approach of RNS Frigate Alpha, significantly increases the threat level. These developments indicate a deliberate escalation in Red's posture.  \n\n• **Escalation Risk**: MODERATE → ELEVATED (conf 0.6 → 0.7)  \n  Driver: The integration of multiple Red assets (frigate, fast attack craft, and coast guard cutter) in close proximity to Blue forces raises the risk of miscalculation or provocation. Exclusion zone enforcement and the presence of armed FAC increase the likelihood of an incident.  \n\n• **Adversary Intent**: PROBABLE → LIKELY (conf 0.55 → 0.7)  \n  Driver: HUMINT, SIGINT, and UAV imagery collectively support the assessment that Red forces are conducting a coordinated area denial operation. The integration of naval, coast guard, and paramilitary assets suggests a deliberate effort to challenge Blue's freedom of navigation patrol.  \n\n---\n\n### RATIONALE\n\n1. **Overall Threat**:  \n   Prior assessment was ELEVATED due to the confirmed presence of Red coast guard forces, fishing fleet anomalies, and the likely proximity of RNS Frigate Alpha. The new intelligence confirming armed fast attack craft embedded in the fishing fleet, along with the southbound approach of the frigate, represents a significant escalation. These developments indicate a deliberate and coordinated effort to project force and challenge Blue's operations, warranting an upgrade to HIGH.  \n\n2. **Escalation Risk**:  \n   Previously assessed as MODERATE due to the potential for miscalculation. The confirmed integration of armed FAC into the fishing fleet, combined with the exclusion zone enforcement and the frigate's approach, significantly increases the risk of an incident.

Briefing Agent — produce the commander's SITREP\n---------- TextMessage (Scenario_Orchestrator) ----------\n**WORLD STATE UPDATE — Turn 3**\n\n### UPDATED ACTORS\n1. **RED: RNS Frigate Alpha (assessed)**  \n   - **Position Update (ASSESSED):** Unchanged, still assessed near Grid AB-09.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** SIGINT reference to \"establish inner cordon\" and \"restrict passage\" suggests involvement in enforcing a maritime exclusion zone.  \n\n2. **RED: Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel**  \n   - **Mission Update (CONFIRMED):** HUMINT confirms orders to use \"all non-kinetic means\" to deny access to foreign warships. Reinforcements (additional coast guard cutters) are en route from the Red mainland, ETA 12-16 hours.  \n\n3. **GRAY: Fishing Fleet (~60 vessels)**  \n   - **Composition Update (CONFIRMED):** UAV Kite-31 lost data link due to directed RF interference from the vicinity of the fishing fleet and embedded fast attack craft. This confirms active electronic warfare (EW) capability within the fleet.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** Likely tasked with electronic warfare and area denial operations in support of Red forces.  \n\n4. **RED: Fast Attack Craft (embedded in fishing fleet)**  \n   - **Status Update (CONFIRMED):** ELINT detected a fire-control radar emission from the vicinity of the fast attack craft group. Assessed as a radar calibration test, not a weapons engagement.  \n   - **Mission Update (ASSESSED):** Increasingly aggressive posture, with EW and fire-control radar activity suggesting preparation for escalation or deterrence.  \n\n5. **BLUE: UAV Kite-31**  \n   - **Status Update (CONFIRMED):** UAV presumed forced landing at sea due to directed RF interference. No longer operational.  \n\n### NEW EVENTS\n1. **T0+0215H:** UAV Kite-31 lost data link due to directed RF interference from the vicinity of the fishing fleet / fast attack craft group. Last telemetry showed power fluctuations consistent with electronic attack. UAV presumed forced landing at sea.  \n2. **T0+0230H:** SIGINT decrypted fragment from Red operational net indicates plans to establish an inner cordon around Cerulean Shoal and restrict passage of foreign vessels within 12 hours. Non-kinetic deterrence measures authorized.  \n3. **T0+0240H:** HUMINT reports Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel ordered to deny access to foreign warships using non-kinetic means. Reinforcements (additional cutters) en route from Red mainland, ETA 12-16 hours.  \n4. **T0+0245H:** ELINT from MPA Lookout-21 detects a 2-second fire-control radar emission on bearing 285 from Resolute, consistent with fast attack craft. Assessed as a radar calibration test, not a weapons engagement.  \n5. **T0+0250H:** Red state media publishes an editorial warning against \"foreign provocations\" and shows footage of naval exercises described as \"routine training.\"  \n\n### RESOLVED UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **Fishing fleet composition unverified:** Resolved with confirmation of active electronic warfare capability and embedded fast attack craft.  \n2. **Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel ROE posture unknown:** Resolved with HUMINT confirmation of orders to use non-kinetic means to deny access to foreign warships.  \n\n### NEW UNCERTAINTIES\n1. **Red fast attack craft intent:** Fire-control radar activity and EW measures suggest preparation for escalation, but specific intent (deterrence vs. harassment vs. engagement) remains unclear.  \n2. **Reinforcements from Red mainland:** Exact composition and timing of additional coast guard cutters remain uncertain.  \n3. **Inner cordon enforcement:** Details of the planned exclusion zone (e.g., boundaries, specific measures) are not yet fully understood.  \n\n### KEY TAKEAWAY\nRed forces are escalating their posture with active electronic warfare, fire-control radar activity, and plans to establish an exclusion zone within 12 hours. Additional reinforcements are en route, increasing the risk of confrontation.\n---------- TextMessage (ISR_Intel_Fusion) ----------\n**INTELLIGENCE FUSION SUMMARY — Turn 3**\n\nCONFIRMED (multi-source corroboration):\n• Red forces are employing electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, evidenced by directed RF interference that caused UAV Kite-31 to lose its data link and likely forced it to land at sea — Sources: UAV Kite-31 (telemetry), ELINT (A-2).  \n• Red Coast Guard Cutter Sentinel has orders to deny access to foreign warships using \"all non-kinetic means\" — Sources: HUMINT (CORAL-7), OSINT (state media).  \n• Red fast attack craft (FAC) embedded in the fishing fleet are employing fire-control radar, with a 2-second emission detected, likely a calibration test — Sources: ELINT (MPA Lookout-21).  \n• Red forces plan to establish an inner cordon around Cerulean Shoal within 12 hours, restricting passage of foreign vessels and authorizing non-kinetic deterrence measures — Sources: SIGINT (decrypted fragment), HUMINT (CORAL-7).  \n\nPROBABLE (single reliable source, consistent with pattern):\n• Red fast attack craft are preparing for escalation or deterrence operations, given their use of fire-control radar and EW measures — Source: ELINT (A-2).  \n• Reinforcements from the Red mainland (additional coast guard cutters) are en route, ETA 12-16 hours, likely to bolster exclusion zone enforcement — Source: HUMINT (CORAL-7).  \n\nPOSSIBLE (unconfirmed / single source / partially contradicted):\n• Red forces may be coordinating a layered area denial operation involving coast guard, frigate, fast attack craft, and EW assets — Source: SIGINT (decrypted fragment), Caveat: No direct evidence of coordination between all assets.  \n\nCONTRADICTIONS REQUIRING RESOLUTION:\n• None identified this cycle.  \n\nINFORMATION GAPS (prioritized):\n1. Specific intent of Red fast attack craft (deterrence, harassment, or engagement).  \n2. Details of the planned inner cordon (e.g., boundaries, enforcement measures, and ROE).  \n3. Composition and capabilities of reinforcements from the Red mainland.  \n\nCOLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS:\n• Task MPA Lookout-21 to maintain ELINT coverage of the fishing fleet and fast attack craft for additional radar or communication activity.  \n• Task BNS Resolute to monitor SIGINT for further decrypted communications regarding the inner cordon and reinforcements.  \n• Exploit OSINT for additional state media or local reporting on Red naval and coast guard activities.  \n• Consider deploying an alternate UAV to replace Kite-31 for ISR coverage of the fishing fleet and surrounding area.  \n\n**ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe situation is now HIGHLY VOLATILE. Red forces are escalating their gray-zone tactics with the integration of EW, fire-control radar activity, and plans to enforce an exclusion zone. The loss of UAV Kite-31 significantly reduces ISR coverage, increasing the risk of undetected adversary actions. Immediate focus should be on understanding the intent behind Red fast attack craft activity and the specifics of the planned inner cordon to assess the likelihood of direct confrontation.\n---------- TextMessage (Assessment_Agent) ----------\n**ASSESSMENT UPDATE — Turn 3**\n\n| Assessment           | Previous   | Updated   | Δ         | Confidence | Key Evidence                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall Threat       | HIGH       | CRITICAL  | ↑         | 0.8 → 0.9  | Red forces employing EW, fire-control radar, and planning an exclusion zone; UAV loss reduces ISR capability. |\n| Escalation Risk      | ELEVATED   | HIGH      | ↑         | 0.7 → 0.8  | Fire-control radar activity, EW measures, and exclusion zone plans indicate preparation for confrontation. |\n| Adversary Intent     | LIKELY     | VERY LIKELY | ↑         | 0.7 → 0.85 | Coordinated actions (EW, radar, cordon plans) strongly suggest deliberate area denial and provocation. |\n\nCHANGELOG:\n• **Overall Threat**: HIGH → CRITICAL (conf 0.8 → 0.9)  \n  Driver: The combination of EW activity, fire-control radar emissions, and plans to establish an exclusion zone within 12 hours represents a significant escalation. The loss of UAV Kite-31 further degrades Blue's situational awareness, increasing the overall threat level.  \n\n• **Escalation Risk**: ELEVATED → HIGH (conf 0.7 → 0.8)  \n  Driver: The use of fire-control radar by Red fast attack craft, coupled with EW interference and exclusion zone enforcement orders, significantly increases the risk of miscalculation or deliberate provocation leading to confrontation.  \n\n• **Adversary Intent**: LIKELY → VERY LIKELY (conf 0.7 → 0.85)  \n  Driver: The deliberate use of EW, radar activity, and exclusion zone plans strongly indicate a coordinated effort to deny Blue's freedom of navigation and provoke a response. These actions are consistent with deliberate gray-zone escalation.  \n\n---\n\n### RATIONALE\n\n1. **Overall Threat**:  \n   Previously assessed as HIGH due to the confirmed presence of armed fast attack craft, the southbound approach of RNS Frigate Alpha, and exclusion zone enforcement. The new intelligence confirming EW activity, fire-control radar emissions, and plans for an exclusion zone within 12 hours represents a significant escalation. The loss of UAV Kite-31 further reduces Blue's ISR capability, increasing the threat level to CRITICAL.  \n\n2. **Escalation Risk**:  \n   Previously assessed as ELEVATED due to the potential for miscalculation. The confirmed use of fire-control radar by Red fast attack craft, coupled with EW interference and exclusion zone plans, significantly increases the likelihood of confrontation. These actions indicate preparation for escalation, justifying an upgrade to HIGH.  \n\n3. **Adversary Intent**:  \n   Previously assessed as LIKELY based on evidence of coordinated area denial operations. The deliberate use of EW, radar activity, and exclusion zone plans strongly suggests a coordinated effort to deny Blue's freedom of navigation and provoke a response. This warrants an upgrade to VERY LIKELY.  \n\n---\n\n### WATCH ITEMS\n• **Red Fast Attack Craft (FAC)**: Monitor for further radar activity or indications of weapon readiness.  \n• **Inner Cordon Plans**: Clarify boundaries, enforcement measures, and ROE for the planned exclusion zone.  \n• **Reinforcements from Red Mainland**: Assess composition, capabilities, and timing of additional coast guard cutters.  \n\n### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n1. **ISR Tasking**:  \n   - Task MPA Lookout-21 to maintain ELINT coverage of the fishing fleet and fast attack craft for additional radar or communication activity.  \n   - Consider deploying an alternate UAV to replace Kite-31 for ISR coverage of the fishing fleet and surrounding area.  \n\n2. **SIGINT Efforts**:  \n   - Prioritize decryption of Red tactical net communications to clarify exclusion zone plans and reinforcements.  \n\n3. **Force Posture**:  \n   - Consider repositioning BNS Resolute to maintain FON objectives while avoiding direct confrontation.  \n   - Prepare contingency plans for potential escalation, including rules of engagement review and force protection measures.  \n\n4. **Diplomatic Engagement**:  \n   - Notify regional partners and allies of the developing situation to coordinate potential responses.  \n   - Consider issuing a public statement reaffirming Blue's commitment to freedom of navigation and challenging unlawful exclusion zones.  \n\nThe situation is now HIGHLY VOLATILE, with a clear need to maintain situational awareness and prepare for potential escalation. Immediate focus should be on understanding Red's exclusion zone plans and ensuring Blue forces are postured to respond effectively to any provocation.\n"

The loss of UAV Kite-31 further degrades Blue's situational awareness, increasing the overall threat level.  \n\n• **Escalation Risk**: ELEVATED → HIGH (conf 0.7 → 0.8)  \n  Driver: The use of fire-control radar by Red fast attack craft, coupled with EW interference and exclusion zone enforcement orders, significantly increases the risk of miscalculation or deliberate provocation leading to confrontation.  \n\n• **Adversary Intent**: LIKELY → VERY LIKELY (conf 0.7 → 0.85)  \n  Driver: The deliberate use of EW, radar activity, and exclusion zone plans strongly indicate a coordinated effort to deny Blue's freedom of navigation and provoke a response. These actions are consistent with deliberate gray-zone escalation.  \n\n---\n\n### RATIONALE\n\n1. **Overall Threat**:  \n   Previously assessed as HIGH due to the confirmed presence of armed fast attack craft, the southbound approach of RNS Frigate Alpha, and exclusion zone enforcement. The new intelligence confirming EW activity, fire-control radar emissions, and plans for an exclusion zone within 12 hours represents a significant escalation. The loss of UAV Kite-31 further reduces Blue's ISR capability, increasing the threat level to CRITICAL.  \n\n2. **Escalation Risk**:  \n   Previously assessed as ELEVATED due to the potential for miscalculation. The confirmed use of fire-control radar by Red fast attack craft, coupled with EW interference and exclusion zone plans, significantly increases the likelihood of confrontation. These actions indicate preparation for escalation, justifying an upgrade to HIGH.  \n\n3. **Adversary Intent**:  \n   Previously assessed as LIKELY based on evidence of coordinated area denial operations. The deliberate use of EW, radar activity, and exclusion zone plans strongly suggests a coordinated effort to deny Blue's freedom of navigation and provoke a response. This warrants an upgrade to VERY LIKELY.  \n\n---\n\n### WATCH ITEMS\n• **Red Fast Attack Craft (FAC)**: Monitor for further radar activity or indications of weapon readiness.  \n• **Inner Cordon Plans**: Clarify boundaries, enforcement measures, and ROE for the planned exclusion zone.  \n• **Reinforcements from Red Mainland**: Assess composition, capabilities, and timing of additional coast guard cutters.  \n\n### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n1. **ISR Tasking**:  \n   - Task MPA Lookout-21 to maintain ELINT coverage of the fishing fleet and fast attack craft for additional radar or communication activity.  \n   - Consider deploying an alternate UAV to replace Kite-31 for ISR coverage of the fishing fleet and surrounding area.  \n\n2. **SIGINT Efforts**:  \n   - Prioritize decryption of Red tactical net communications to clarify exclusion zone plans and reinforcements.  \n\n3. **Force Posture**:  \n   - Consider repositioning BNS Resolute to maintain FON objectives while avoiding direct confrontation.  \n   - Prepare contingency plans for potential escalation, including rules of engagement review and force protection measures.  \n\n4. **Diplomatic Engagement**:  \n   - Notify regional partners and allies of the developing situation to coordinate potential responses.  \n   - Consider issuing a public statement reaffirming Blue's commitment to freedom of navigation and challenging unlawful exclusion zones.  \n\nThe situation is now HIGHLY VOLATILE, with a clear need to maintain situational awareness and prepare for potential escalation. Immediate focus should be on understanding Red's exclusion zone plans and ensuring Blue forces are postured to respond effectively to any provocation."

AIS transponders broadcast false fishing vessel identities.  \n   - **Assessment:** Hull forms and AIS inconsistencies are consistent with Red fast attack craft or auxiliary vessels.  \n   - **Source Reliability:** A-2 (UAV imagery is reliable, but interpretation introduces some uncertainty).  \n\n2. **UAV Kite-31 Imagery (Turn 3)**  \n   - **Observation:** Close pass confirms weapon canisters covered with tarps and a concealed radome consistent with a surface search radar.  \n   - **Assessment:** These features are characteristic of fast attack craft, not fishing vessels.  \n   - **Source Reliability:** A-2 (Imagery is reliable, but visual confirmation of weapon canisters under tarps is indirect).  \n\n3. **ELINT from MPA Lookout-21 (Turn 3)**  \n   - **Observation:** Fire-control radar emission detected for 2 seconds on bearing 285 from Resolute, consistent with fast attack craft radar calibration.  \n   - **Assessment:** Fire-control radar is not used by fishing vessels, strongly suggesting the presence of armed fast attack craft.  \n   - **Source Reliability:** A-2 (ELINT is reliable, but the duration of the emission limits full characterization).  \n\n4. **UAV Kite-31 Telemetry (Turn 3)**  \n   - **Observation:** UAV lost data link due to directed RF interference from the vicinity of the fishing fleet.  \n   - **Assessment:** Directed RF interference indicates electronic warfare capability, which is not consistent with civilian fishing vessels.  \n   - **Source Reliability:** A-2 (Telemetry is reliable, but the precise source of interference cannot be confirmed without additional data).  \n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of imagery, ELINT, and telemetry strongly supports the assessment that the three suspect vessels are Red fast attack craft embedded within the fishing fleet. However, the Commander’s alternative hypothesis (fishing boats with unusual hull forms) cannot be fully ruled out without further ISR confirmation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Assessment Agent: Threat Assessment Under Alternative Hypothesis**\nIf the three vessels are fishing boats with unusual hull forms rather than fast attack craft, the following changes to the threat assessment would apply:\n\n1. **Overall Threat Level:**  \n   - **Current:** CRITICAL (0.9 confidence).  \n   - **Revised:** MODERATE (0.6 confidence).  \n   - **Rationale:** Without fast attack craft, the fishing fleet poses a reduced direct threat to Blue forces. However, the presence of RF interference and exclusion zone plans still indicate a coordinated gray-zone operation.  \n\n2. **Escalation Risk:**  \n   - **Current:** HIGH (0.8 confidence).  \n   - **Revised:** ELEVATED (0.6 confidence).  \n   - **Rationale:** The absence of fast attack craft reduces the likelihood of direct confrontation, but the use of EW and exclusion zone enforcement still carries a risk of miscalculation or provocation.  \n\n3. **Adversary Intent:**  \n   - **Current:** VERY LIKELY (0.85 confidence).  \n   - **Revised:** LIKELY (0.7 confidence).  \n   - **Rationale:** The absence of fast attack craft suggests a less aggressive posture, but the coordinated use of EW and exclusion zone enforcement still indicates deliberate intent to challenge Blue's freedom of navigation.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Briefing Agent: Bottom-Line Answer**\n**Commander, the evidence chain for identifying the three suspect vessels as fast attack craft is based on multiple sources: UAV imagery showing weapon canisters and radomes, ELINT detecting fire-control radar emissions, and telemetry indicating electronic warfare interference. While this evidence strongly supports the fast attack craft assessment, it is not conclusive.**\n\n**If these vessels are instead fishing boats with unusual hull forms, the overall threat level would decrease from CRITICAL to MODERATE, and the escalation risk would drop from HIGH to ELEVATED. However, the presence of RF interference, exclusion zone enforcement, and coordinated Red actions still represent a significant gray-zone challenge. Additional ISR is required to confirm the vessels' true nature.**\n---------- TextMessage (Assessment_Agent) ----------\n### ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION FOR COMMANDER\n\n**To resolve the ambiguity regarding the suspect vessels, I recommend:**\n1. **Tasking MPA Lookout-21** to conduct a focused ISR sweep of the fishing fleet for further ELINT and visual confirmation of the vessels' characteristics and activity patterns.  \n2. **Deploying an alternate UAV** to replace Kite-31 for closer inspection of the fleet, with a focus on identifying weapon systems or additional electronic warfare activity.  \n3. **Prioritizing SIGINT decryption** to determine whether Red operational communications reference the suspect vessels' roles or capabilities.  \n\nThis approach will clarify the vessels' identity and allow for a more precise threat assessment.\n"
