A Multi-Model Selector visibly chooses between scripted heuristics and LLM reasoning at each decision step, demonstrating the hybrid multi-model concept.\n",

No real-world operational data, contingency plans, systems, or intelligence are used or represented. The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority. All agent outputs are recommendations and analysis — not orders or directives. Final decisions remain with the human operator at all times.*\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **Environment variables** (`AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL`) point to a model deployed in [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio).\n",
        "2. **`AzureAIChatCompletionClient`** connects AutoGen to that endpoint using the [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/reference/reference-model-inference-api). This is the same API regardless of which model you deploy (GPT-4o, Mistral, Llama, etc.), so you can swap models without changing code.\n",
        "3. **`model_info`** describes the model's capabilities — AutoGen uses this metadata to decide how to format prompts (e.g., whether to use structured JSON output, function calling, or plain text).\n",
        "4. **`AzureKeyCredential`** wraps your API key into a credential object. For production workloads, consider using [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) with `DefaultAzureCredential` instead of API keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Swap models easily:** Because the Azure AI Model Inference API is model-agnostic, you can change `FOUNDRY_MODEL` to any model deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project — no other code changes needed. See [Supported models in Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) for a full catalog.\n"

Emphasis on balance between securing the strait and mitigating risks from identified threats, particularly the Red submarine Hotel (SSN) and Red surface combatants.\n\n---\n\n### UNIT RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n• **BLUE Destroyer Alpha (DDG)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (4,2)  \n  *Rationale:* Positioned to counter Red SSN Hotel near (6,2) and to screen the western side of the strait. The DDG has strong ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) capability and multi-threat survivability.\n\n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (4,6)  \n  *Rationale:* Well-placed to monitor Red Frigate Foxtrot (likely surface threat) at (7,6) while positioning in the center of the strait. Reinforces multi-axis coverage and balances risk in areas closer to Red forces.\n\n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** → Suggested Action: **SWEEP** at (5,3)  \n  *Rationale:* Positioned just south of the strait in a low-risk zone to serve as a backup \"rapid reposition\" asset. The PC's mobility is useful for asymmetry, but it stays guarded given low defensive capability against submarines or frigates.\n\n### Heuristic Proposals (Acknowledged and Valid):\n• BLUE MPA Delta: **PATROL** at (4,5)  \n• BLUE UAV Echo: **PATROL** at (4,8)  \n*(These units are already aligned with strait ISR and surface threat detection responsibilities.)*\n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION REQUEST TO AIR WARFARE:\n• **Request ISR coverage from UAV Echo** focused on area east of strait (rows 4-7, cols 7-9). This alignment ensures early detection of Red PC Golf and enhances situational awareness on Red Frigate Foxtrot's movements.  \n• **Request anti-submarine ISR support from MPA Delta** to visually check (6,2)-(6,4) for Red SSN Hotel within strike range of strait ops.\n\n---\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe primary risk is overexposing units to Red’s offensive capabilities (Frigate Foxtrot or Submarine Hotel) within the strait area. Covering the submarine at (6,2) is critical, but positioning DDG Alpha in closer proximity effectively reduces risk while retaining full combat power for escalation if needed. Surface units in the strait must rely on coordinated ISR to mitigate unseen threats.\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**  \nThe strait’s center and eastern end require consistent ISR and screening to prevent gaps exploitable by Red. Strategic flexibility allows for future adaptive interception or repositioning of assets."

Ensure coverage of high-value zones while minimizing overexposure of air assets.\n\n---\n\n### UNIT RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (6,3)  \n  *Rationale:* Shifts to the southern strait to focus on detecting Red SSN Hotel near (6,2)-(6,4). MPA's robust ASW sensors are optimal for submarine detection in the area, providing immediate intelligence updates for Blue surface forces.\n\n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (5,9)  \n  *Rationale:* Extends visibility eastward, monitoring Red PC Golf at (8,4) and any emerging movements from Red Frigate Foxtrot at (7,6). UAV's persistent surface search capability covers potential eastern encroachment into the strait.\n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION RESPONSE TO SURFACE WARFARE:\n• The requests for **ISR coverage east of the strait** and **anti-submarine detection near Red SSN Hotel** are acknowledged and addressed:  \n   - **UAV Echo** will patrol (5,9), focusing on eastern surface threats.  \n   - **MPA Delta** will shift patrol to (6,3), optimizing ASW coverage near the submarine’s assessed location.  \n\n---\n\n### ISR PRIORITIES:\n1. **Primary:** Detect and track Red SSN Hotel (6,2) — critical threat to Blue forces operating in the strait.  \n2. **Secondary:** Monitor Red surface movements, especially Red Frigate Foxtrot (7,6) and Red Patrol Craft Golf (8,4), for encroachment into the strait.\n\n---\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nBoth air assets are operating within calculated safety margins. UAV Echo remains at safe standoff east of the strait, minimizing exposure to Red surface threats. MPA Delta ventures closer to Red SSN Hotel’s assessed location but within its anti-submarine protective range; acceptable for short-term, high-priority submarine detection.\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**  \nThe air assets’ positioning maximizes Blue situational awareness, enabling early warning and rapid threat response. Continued coordination with surface units will be vital to adapt ISR collection as Red movements unfold."

New subsurface contact detected.\nComms degraded: False\nNovel encounters: True\n\nFEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS TURN:\n**FEEDBACK SUMMARY — Turn 1**\n\n---\n\n**OUTCOMES:**  \n• **BLUE Destroyer Alpha (DDG)** — PATROL → Moved to (4,2). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** — PATROL → Moved to (4,6). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** — SCREEN → Maintained position at (5,3). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** — PATROL → Moved to (6,3). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** — PATROL → Moved to (5,9). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n\n---\n\n**INTENT VS. REALITY:**  \n• **Commander wanted:** Secure control of the Cerulean Strait and deny Red forces access, with a proactive ISR to track submarine and surface threats. Preserve combat power by avoiding undue risks.  \n• **Actual result:** All Blue units achieved positioning objectives, effectively securing the strait and establishing ISR. No Red contacts were observed.  \n• **Gap:** Aligned. No discrepancies between intent and outcomes were detected.  \n\n---\n\n**EMERGING PATTERNS:**  \n• **First turn — insufficient data.** No Red movements or encounters have been observed yet, leaving early uncertainty regarding Red’s intent or strategy.  \n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS TO COMMANDER:**  \n1. Maintain current strait control posture while enhancing situational awareness. With no current Red provocations, Blue forces can remain cautious and consolidate control.  \n2. Proactively reposition Blue assets next turn to prepare for possible Red escalation. Prioritize anti-submarine and surface interdiction layers, focusing on high-probability Red movement zones (e.g., strait entry points and adjacent proximity to Red units).  \n\nIssue your Commander's Intent for this turn.\n\nHEURISTIC (pre-computed) OPERATOR RESULTS:\n  • BLUE Destroyer Alpha: PATROL → (4,2) — Moved to new position. No contacts observed.\n  • BLUE Frigate Bravo: PATROL → (4,6) — Moved to new position. No contacts observed.\n  • BLUE MPA Delta: PATROL → (4,5) — Moved to new position. No contacts observed.\n\nUNITS REQUIRING LLM REASONING (handle in Operator phase):\n  BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie, BLUE UAV Echo\n\nProcess this turn through the full hierarchy:\n1. Commander — provide recommended intent with sub-objectives for Surface and Air Managers\n2. Surface Warfare Manager — propose surface unit positions and create plan\n3. Air Warfare Manager — propose air/ISR asset positions and create plan\n4. Unit Operators — carry out recommended actions for LLM-routed units; acknowledge heuristic results; flag any INTERCEPT actions as requiring human confirmation\n5. Feedback Aggregator — summarize outcomes and recommendations\n6. Explainability Agent — produce transparent reasoning trace explaining why each agent reached its conclusion"

The unknown submarine contact's proximity to Blue UAV Echo at (5,9) suggests prioritizing ISR coverage in that sector, balancing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) measures with strait control. Unknown sub contacts should not yet provoke commitment of high-value units like Destroyer Alpha unless escalation is verified.\n\nDECISION POINTS AHEAD:  \n• If unknown submarine contact at (5,8) moves closer to Blue units or the strait, surface assets may need to adopt a more aggressive ASW posture, potentially including close engagement by Patrol Craft Charlie.  \n• If Red surface forces (e.g., Patrol Craft Golf at (7,3) or Frigate Foxtrot at (6,5)) threaten critical regions of the strait, recommend repositioning Blue Frigate Bravo and Destroyer Alpha to block access while maintaining standoff capabilities.  \n• Confirm unknown submarine contact as hostile or neutral before altering the risk posture. Enhanced ISR data from Air assets next turn will guide decisions."

Positioned to act as a flexible response asset for any immediate threats.  \n\n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** → Suggested Action: **SCREEN** at (4,6)  \n  *Rationale:* Maintains position on the eastern end of the strait, holding control and monitoring Red surface force movements (e.g., Frigate Foxtrot at (6,5)). Active radar and sonar screening bolster ISR coverage in the area.  \n\n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** → Suggested Action: **SCREEN** at (5,4)  \n  *Rationale:* Moves one grid east to closely patrol mid-strait while remaining within a relatively safe distance from likely threats (e.g., SSN Hotel at (6,2) or unknown sub at (5,8)). Remains prepared for rapid response if Red Patrol Craft Golf (7,3) advances northward.  \n\n---\n\n### Heuristic Proposals (Acknowledged and Valid):  \n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** — PATROL at (4,5): Refines ISR coverage over the central strait while maintaining airborne vigilance of both submarine and surface contacts.  \n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** — PATROL at (5,8): Focuses ISR assets on unknown submarine contact to confirm its identity and intent. Positioned directly overhead for visual and electronic monitoring.  \n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION REQUEST TO AIR WARFARE:  \n• **Request MPA Delta** prioritize ASW detection south of the strait (rows 5-7, cols 3-6) to resolve uncertainty regarding Red SSN Hotel and assist in tracking Red surface movements.  \n• **Request UAV Echo** remain in the vicinity of (5,8) to maintain contact on the unknown submarine and investigate further. Critical to determine if this contact poses an imminent risk to Blue forces or the strait.  \n\n---\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe largest risk stems from the **unknown submarine contact at (5,8)**, which introduces ambiguity into strait operations. If hostile, it could threaten UAV Echo or surface units like Patrol Craft Charlie. However, reallocating airborne ISR assets to counter the submarine mitigates some uncertainty, while Destroyer Alpha provides a flexible counter-ASW capability if the threat is confirmed. A secondary risk includes Red surface forces converging on the strait, particularly Patrol Craft Golf or Frigate Foxtrot; however, Blue positions are currently optimized to deny access.  \n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**  \nStandoff posturing by Blue surface units ensures control is maintained while risks are minimized. Future turns may require adaptive repositioning depending on Red maneuvers or confirmed hostile intent by the unknown submarine."

Ensure situational awareness and readiness to support both ASW and surface engagements without overexposing airborne assets.\n\n---\n\n### UNIT RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (5,6)  \n  *Rationale:* Refocuses ASW capabilities southward, directly addressing potential submarine threats in the region (e.g., SSN Hotel at (6,2) and unknown contact at (5,8)). This position optimally supports ASW efforts while monitoring nearby surface movements, especially Frigate Foxtrot (6,5).  \n\n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** → Suggested Action: **TRACK** at (5,8)  \n  *Rationale:* Hovering over the unknown submarine contact provides continuous surveillance, aiding in resolving its identity and intent. UAV Echo remains at a safe altitude, minimizing risk, while providing real-time updates to Blue surface units.  \n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION RESPONSE TO SURFACE WARFARE:  \n• Objectives aligning with requests:  \n  - **MPA Delta's ASW focus** across rows 5-7 and cols 3-6 will aid in refining unresolved subsurface contact data while tracking other Red submarine and surface movements south of the strait.  \n  - **UAV Echo's direct ISR over (5,8)** ensures persistent monitoring of the unknown submarine, confirming its identity or highlighting movement patterns.  \n\n• **Supporting Straits Control:**  \n  ISR coverage from both air assets (MPA and UAV) ensures comprehensive awareness over central and southern strait areas, mitigating risks of Red incursion or submerged threats against Blue forces.\n\n---\n\n### ISR PRIORITIES:\n1. **Primary:** Resolve identity and intent of the unknown submarine contact at (5,8).  \n2. **Secondary:** Track Red SSN Hotel's movements in the vicinity of (6,2).  \n3. **Tertiary:** Monitor Red surface forces (e.g., Frigate Foxtrot and Patrol Craft Golf) for encroachment into the strait.\n\n---\n\n### RISK ASSESSMENT:  \n• **UAV Echo:** Moderate risk due to proximity to the unknown submarine contact, but strategic altitude and mobility reduce potential exposure to direct attack.  \n• **MPA Delta:** Slight risk of escalation if Red SSN Hotel is repositioning aggressively. The MPA's ASW capabilities provide a buffer against sudden threats.  \n\n---\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**  \n- Close ISR coordination between air and surface units is critical to de-escalate the situation unless the unknown submarine contact demonstrates hostile intent.  \n- Both air assets remain positioned with flexibility to shift focus or disengage if the threat level increases.  \n- On detecting active threats, future turns may necessitate ISR redistribution or direct engagement support to Blue surface units.

Continuing close-range monitoring of unknown submarine contact. No aggressive behavior detected.  \nReadiness: 100%  \n\n---\n\n**FEEDBACK AGGREGATOR — Turn 2 Outcomes:**  \n1. Blue forces now hold optimized positions within the Cerulean Strait to monitor and deny Red force entry.  \n2. ISR prioritization ensures continuous tracking of the unknown submarine contact at (5,8), with no additional contacts observed this turn.  \n3. Red surface movements remain consistent with previous maneuvers, with no direct escalation into the strait observed at this time.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  \n1. Continue to monitor the unknown submarine contact at (5,8) for further identification. Current posture is effective, but readiness should remain high in case of escalation.  \n2. Maintain anti-submarine focus around (5,6) to (7,6), as Red SSN Hotel (6,2) remains a probable risk to Blue assets.  \n3. Ensure surface units can rapidly interdict if Red Patrol Craft Golf (7,3) or Frigate Foxtrot (6,5) advance into the strait.  \n\n---\n\n**EXPLAINABILITY AGENT — Reasoning Trace:**  \n1. **Commander’s Intent:** Directed Blue forces to consolidate control of the strait and refine detection of submarine threats while minimizing risk.  \n2. **Surface Warfare Plan:** Balanced patrol and screening maneuvers to maintain strait control and prepare for potential responses to Red surface threats.  \n3. **Air Warfare Plan:** Focused ISR directly on unknown submarine contact (5,8) while maintaining broader awareness of Red submarine (6,2) and surface unit movements.  \n4. **Operator Adjustments:** All suggested actions were feasible and carried out as planned, with no unexpected tactical deviations.  \n5. **Outcome Alignment:** All objectives for Turn 2 were achieved, with the unknown submarine contact successfully monitored and the strait securely controlled. Tactical flexibility allows rapid adaptation as threat levels or Red force intentions become clearer."

No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** — SCREEN → Maintained position at (4,6). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** — SCREEN → Moved to (5,4). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** — PATROL → Moved to (5,6). Continuing ASW focus. No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** — TRACK → Monitoring unknown submarine contact at (5,8). No additional hostile or aggressive behavior detected. (Readiness: 100%)  \n\n---\n\n**INTENT VS. REALITY:**  \n• **Commander wanted:** Solidify control of the strait while enhancing ISR, particularly on the unknown submarine contact. Deny Red forces access without unnecessary risk to Blue units.  \n• **Actual result:** Blue forces maintained effective control of the Cerulean Strait, optimized ISR coverage, and monitored the unknown submarine contact without provocation or conflict. No Red forces entered the strait or demonstrated hostility.  \n• **Gap:** Aligned. No deviations from the Commander’s intent occurred, and all sub-objectives were achieved.  \n\n---\n\n**EMERGING PATTERNS:**  \n• **Submarine presence increasing:** Detection of a second (unknown) submarine contact introduces a new dimension to Red's potential strategy. Red may be focusing on deploying subsurface assets to pressure the strait or probe Blue force vulnerabilities.  \n• **Conservative Red surface maneuvers:** Red surface forces (e.g., Patrol Craft Golf and Frigate Foxtrot) continue repositioning southward but avoid direct confrontations, potentially indicating intent to test Blue control of the strait in the next turn.  \n• **ISR facilitating dominance:** Blue’s current ISR posture is providing robust situational awareness over the strait and adjacent threat zones, minimizing uncertainty.  \n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS TO COMMANDER:**  \n1. **Focus on anti-submarine warfare (ASW):** Maintain vigilance on the unknown submarine contact at (5,8) while expanding coverage around the probable operational area of Red SSN Hotel (6,2). The increased submarine activity indicates a need for continued ASW prioritization.  \n2. **Prepare for possible escalation:** While Red surface units are avoiding direct movements into the strait, their proximity warrants readiness for interception. Consider preemptive positioning of high-capability units (e.g., Destroyer Alpha) to cover potential vector points into the strait in case of sudden Red advances.  \n\nBy continuing to apply pressure through a layered ISR strategy and maintaining defensive control of the strait, Blue forces remain well-positioned to deter or respond to Red’s next moves while preserving combat effectiveness."

RED frigate closing the strait.\nComms degraded: True\nNovel encounters: True\n\nFEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS TURN:\n**FEEDBACK SUMMARY — Turn 2**  \n\n---\n\n**OUTCOMES:**  \n• **BLUE Destroyer Alpha (DDG)** — PATROL → Moved to (4,3). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** — SCREEN → Maintained position at (4,6). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** — SCREEN → Moved to (5,4). No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** — PATROL → Moved to (5,6). Continuing ASW focus. No contacts observed. (Readiness: 100%)  \n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** — TRACK → Monitoring unknown submarine contact at (5,8). No additional hostile or aggressive behavior detected. (Readiness: 100%)  \n\n---\n\n**INTENT VS. REALITY:**  \n• **Commander wanted:** Solidify control of the strait while enhancing ISR, particularly on the unknown submarine contact. Deny Red forces access without unnecessary risk to Blue units.  \n• **Actual result:** Blue forces maintained effective control of the Cerulean Strait, optimized ISR coverage, and monitored the unknown submarine contact without provocation or conflict. No Red forces entered the strait or demonstrated hostility.  \n• **Gap:** Aligned. No deviations from the Commander’s intent occurred, and all sub-objectives were achieved.  \n\n---\n\n**EMERGING PATTERNS:**  \n• **Submarine presence increasing:** Detection of a second (unknown) submarine contact introduces a new dimension to Red's potential strategy. Red may be focusing on deploying subsurface assets to pressure the strait or probe Blue force vulnerabilities.  \n• **Conservative Red surface maneuvers:** Red surface forces (e.g., Patrol Craft Golf and Frigate Foxtrot) continue repositioning southward but avoid direct confrontations, potentially indicating intent to test Blue control of the strait in the next turn.  \n• **ISR facilitating dominance:** Blue’s current ISR posture is providing robust situational awareness over the strait and adjacent threat zones, minimizing uncertainty.  \n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS TO COMMANDER:**  \n1. **Focus on anti-submarine warfare (ASW):** Maintain vigilance on the unknown submarine contact at (5,8) while expanding coverage around the probable operational area of Red SSN Hotel (6,2). The increased submarine activity indicates a need for continued ASW prioritization.  \n2. **Prepare for possible escalation:** While Red surface units are avoiding direct movements into the strait, their proximity warrants readiness for interception. Consider preemptive positioning of high-capability units (e.g., Destroyer Alpha) to cover potential vector points into the strait in case of sudden Red advances.  \n\nBy continuing to apply pressure through a layered ISR strategy and maintaining defensive control of the strait, Blue forces remain well-positioned to deter or respond to Red’s next moves while preserving combat effectiveness.\n\nIssue your Commander's Intent for this turn.\n\nUNITS REQUIRING LLM REASONING (handle in Operator phase):\n  BLUE Destroyer Alpha, BLUE Frigate Bravo, BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie, BLUE MPA Delta, BLUE UAV Echo\n\nProcess this turn through the full hierarchy:\n1.

Preserve full combat power through cautious yet deliberate action.\n\nSUB-OBJECTIVES (prioritized):\n1. **Prevent Red surface forces from breaching or contesting the strait** → Recommended for: Surface Warfare Manager  \n   Suggested Operating Area: rows 4-5, cols 3-6 (focus on monitoring and containing Red Frigate Foxtrot and Patrol Craft Golf)  \n   Risk Tolerance: BALANCED  \n\n2. **Enhance anti-submarine warfare (ASW) coverage to neutralize potential subsurface threats** → Recommended for: Air Warfare Manager  \n   Suggested Operating Area: rows 4-6, cols 2-9 (prioritize tracking known Red SSN Hotel at (5,2) and the unknown sub contact at (5,8))  \n   Risk Tolerance: CAUTIOUS  \n\n3. **Re-establish strait-wide enforcement while preparing for adaptive interception of any Red escalation** → Recommended for: Surface Warfare Manager  \n   Suggested Operating Area: rows 4-6, cols 2-7 (focus on Blue Destroyer Alpha and Blue Frigate Bravo positioning to enable flexible response to both surface and subsurface threats)  \n   Risk Tolerance: BALANCED  \n\nGUIDANCE: Red forces have significantly escalated their positioning near the strait, with Frigate Foxtrot moving to a threatening location at (5,5) and the simultaneous detection of dual submarine contacts (Red SSN Hotel and the low-confidence unknown contact). Blue forces must solidify their defensive control over key vector points with overlapping surface and subsurface coverage. Adaptive layering of ASW and intercept-ready screening will deter Red from capitalizing on this multi-domain posture.\n\nDECISION POINTS AHEAD:  \n• **Red Frigate Foxtrot incurs the strait:** If Red Frigate Foxtrot breaches into the strait or takes hostile actions, shift Blue Destroyer Alpha and Blue Frigate Bravo to form an intercept posture with supporting firepower.  \n• **Aggressive submarine movements:** If either submarine moves aggressively or threatens Blue assets near the strait, direct Blue Patrol Craft Charlie and Blue MPA Delta to prioritize ASW engagement and containment efforts. Validate enemy status before committing to direct offensive actions.  \n• **Degraded communications impact:** Ensure Blue UAV Echo and Blue MPA Delta ISR efforts sustain redundancy to mitigate potential gaps caused by Red’s electronic warfare efforts this turn.  \n\nThis turn will test Blue’s ability to maintain dominance across both the surface and subsurface domains, preempting Red advances while minimizing undue risk to Blue forces."

Preserve Blue combat effectiveness and enable a rapid response to potential Red breaches or escalations into the strait.\n\n---\n\n### UNIT RECOMMENDATIONS:  \n\n• **BLUE Destroyer Alpha (DDG)** → Suggested Action: **INTERCEPT STANCE** at (4,4)  \n  *Rationale:* Positioned to challenge Red Frigate Foxtrot at (5,5) if it breaches deeper into the strait. The DDG’s multi-mission capabilities allow it to address surface aggression and subsurface threats, forming a robust anchor to enforce control of the strait’s center-west area.  \n\n• **BLUE Frigate Bravo (FFG)** → Suggested Action: **PATROL** at (5,6)  \n  *Rationale:* Moves slightly southward to counterbalance the Red Frigate Foxtrot threat and to maintain pressure along the eastern lanes of the Cerulean Strait. This position is central to monitoring both surface incursions and any subsurface activity along the eastern vector.  \n\n• **BLUE Patrol Craft Charlie (PC)** → Suggested Action: **HOLD ASW POSITION** at (5,3)  \n  *Rationale:* Remains near the western portion of the strait, ready to support anti-submarine operations against Red SSN Hotel (5,2). This position enables flexible support to Blue Destroyer Alpha’s area of influence, leveraging the PC’s quick mobility within its operating limit.  \n\n---\n\n### Heuristic Proposals (Acknowledged and Valid):  \n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** — PATROL at (4,3): Focuses anti-submarine ISR on Red SSN Hotel (5,2) and nearby zones to maintain constant tracking and reduce ambiguity regarding the submarine threat's intent and movement.  \n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** — TRACK at (5,8): Continues monitoring the unknown submarine contact in preparation for classification and response. UAV operations are critical to retaining ISR redundancy amidst degraded comms.  \n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION REQUEST TO AIR WARFARE:  \n• **Request MPA Delta prioritize ASW operations** near (5,2) to closely monitor Red SSN Hotel and evaluate any direct subsurface threats to Blue forces.  \n• **Request UAV Echo maintain ISR on unknown submarine contact** at (5,8). Mitigation of comms degradation requires layered coverage from UAV and manned airborne assets to sustain fidelity on subsurface contacts. Also request any electronic support measures (ESM) availability to track EW sources.  \n\n---\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nThe primary risk stems from Red’s dual-domain threat posture with Frigate Foxtrot closing at (5,5) and two submarine contacts near the strait. Red SSN Hotel (5,2) is a more urgent subsurface concern given its proximity to high-value Blue assets, particularly Patrol Craft Charlie, but the unknown sub contact (5,8) cannot be discounted. Maintaining flexible, staggered Blue positions with a surface combatant-heavy focus mitigates the risk of overwhelming escalation, while ISR prioritization on subsurface objectives helps refine situational clarity.\n\nSecondary risks include electronic warfare impacts on ISR and coordination within the battlespace. UAV Echo and MPA Delta providing overlapping coverage help manage this threat, sustaining awareness across all zones of concern.  \n\n---\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**  \nThe layered posture combined with proactive positioning ensures the Cerulean Strait remains under Blue control. Destroyer Alpha and Frigate Bravo’s coordinated stances provide critical interception capabilities to counter Red Frigate Foxtrot or future surface breaches, while Patrol Craft Charlie and airborne ISR assets maintain the ASW focus needed to address Red’s subsurface presence. Future turns may necessitate direct ASW engagement or escalation to prevent Red from exploiting any gaps."

Provide layered ISR redundancy in light of degraded communications and electronic warfare threats.\n\n---\n\n### UNIT RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n• **BLUE MPA Delta (MPA)** → Suggested Action: **TRACK** at (5,4)  \n  *Rationale:* Focuses on tracking Red SSN Hotel at (5,2) while providing overlapping ASW coverage in the western portion of the strait. Maintaining positioning at this grid optimizes both detection and potential response capabilities without direct exposure to immediate threats.\n\n• **BLUE UAV Echo (UAV)** → Suggested Action: **TRACK** at (5,8)  \n  *Rationale:* Continues focused ISR on the unknown submarine contact, ensuring continuous situational awareness as a priority sensor asset. By providing coverage near (5,8), the UAV offers the necessary persistence to help classify or monitor the unknown sub's intent.\n\n---\n\n### COORDINATION RESPONSE TO SURFACE WARFARE:  \n• **MPA Delta's repositioning near (5,4)** supports Surface Warfare's ASW objectives by enhancing tracking of Red SSN Hotel at (5,2). This coverage addresses a crucial threat point near Blue Patrol Craft Charlie and Destroyer Alpha's areas of influence.  \n• **UAV Echo’s persistence over (5,8)** ensures continuous ISR on the unknown submarine contact, assisting in resolving ambiguities about its nature while mitigating communication gaps through electronic support measures (ESM) as feasible.  \n\n---\n\n### ISR PRIORITIES:\n1. **Primary:** Maintain continuous tracking of Red SSN Hotel at (5,2), a high-confidence submarine capable of threatening Blue surface assets in its vicinity.  \n2. **Secondary:** Persist in monitoring the unknown submarine contact at (5,8) to resolve its identity and intent.  \n3. **Tertiary:** Layer ISR coverage to counteract the effects of degraded communication, particularly with persistent ISR in critical zones near the strait.\n\n---\n\n### RISK ASSESSMENT:  \n• **MPA Delta:** Operating in proximity to Red SSN Hotel at (5,2) introduces moderate risk of exposure to subsurface or surface threats in the event of active engagement. However, careful management of patrol areas and continuous maneuvering can mitigate this risk.  \n• **UAV Echo:** Proximity to the unknown submarine contact at (5,8) poses minimal risk due to safe altitude and distance, ensuring high persistence without exposing the UAV to direct threats.  \n• **Electronic Warfare Impact:** Degraded communications emphasize the importance of overlapping ISR coverage. MPA Delta and UAV Echo working in tandem help sustain situational awareness and mitigate the EW’s impact on Blue coordination.\n\n---\n\n### ADDITIONAL NOTES:  \nBlue air assets are well-positioned to address the dual submarine threats while maintaining layered ISR capabilities to track Red forces within and around the strait. The focus on ASW ensures no gaps near the high-priority areas around (5,2) and (5,8). Future turns may necessitate shifting ISR coverage based on Red movements or new electronic warfare signals, but the current plan provides sufficient flexibility to adapt as the situation evolves."

Key recommendations include:  \n1. Retain intercept-ready stances for Destroyer Alpha and Frigate Bravo to counter Red Frigate Foxtrot. Reassess Red intent based on maneuvers next turn.  \n2. Continue ISR tracking of both Red SSN Hotel (5,2) and the unknown submarine contact (5,8). Confirm hostile or neutral status before Blue engages subsurface assets.  \n3. Ensure overlapping coverage of strait zones to prevent Red from exploiting potential gaps.  \n\n---\n\n**EXPLAINABILITY AGENT — Reasoning Trace:**  \n1. **Commander’s Intent:** Directed Blue to secure the strait while addressing Red surface and subsurface escalation, maintaining ISR and combat readiness.  \n2. **Surface Warfare Plan:** Positioned Destroyer Alpha and Frigate Bravo to cover Red Frigate Foxtrot, while Patrol Craft Charlie reinforced ASW near SSN Hotel.  \n3. **Air Warfare Plan:** Focused ISR on SSN Hotel and unknown submarine contact, aligning coverage to counteract EW impact.  \n4. **Operator Adjustments:** Patrol Craft Charlie moved slightly east to form effective ASW layers with Destroyer Alpha. No significant deviations.  \n5. **Outcome Alignment:** Turn objectives fully achieved, with strong Blue positioning and effective ISR mitigating Red’s threats. Turn 4 will likely require escalation-ready positions to deter aggressive Red maneuvers."

However, their proximity to key Blue positions still warrants caution.  \n• **Red Frigate Foxtrot pressuring the strait:** Foxtrot’s positioning at (5,5) suggests probing of Blue control, likely as a prelude to further maneuvers or testing Blue’s reaction capability.  \n• **Red Patrol Craft Golf maneuvering cautiously:** Golf’s repositioning near (6,3) indicates a possible attempt to flank or exploit gaps in Blue coverage. This movement requires tracking in future turns.  \n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS TO COMMANDER:**  \n1. **Advance readiness to counter potential Red aggression:** Red Frigate Foxtrot’s close approach demands immediate readiness for direct engagement next turn. Ensure Blue surface combatants maintain intercept stances, particularly Destroyer Alpha at (4,4) and Frigate Bravo at (5,6).  \n2. **Sustain ASW focus on dual subsurface threats:** MPA Delta and UAV Echo must continue persistent ISR over Red SSN Hotel (5,2) and the unknown submarine contact (5,8). If either contact demonstrates hostile intent, coordinate ASW engagement with surface units.  \n3. **Mitigate EW impact through redundancy:** Red’s electronic warfare capabilities may again degrade Blue comms. Overlapping ISR and clearly defined roles for Blue units will ensure continuity of control and coordinated responses.  \n\nBy maintaining layered defense across both surface and subsurface domains, Blue forces remain well-positioned to deter or respond to Red aggression in the Cerulean Strait. If Red attempts to escalate, the intercept-ready posture mitigates risks while preserving Blue’s combat capacity."
