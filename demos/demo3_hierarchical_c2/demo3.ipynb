    "## Multi-Echelon Decision Decomposition with Hybrid Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**OODA Phase: Decide / Act (across echelons)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Run a compact micro-wargame where decisions decompose across a three-level hierarchy: a Commander sets intent and prioritizes objectives, Managers allocate resources and create synchronized sub-plans, and Operators execute actions on a simple grid. A Multi-Model Selector visibly chooses between scripted heuristics and LLM reasoning at each decision step, demonstrating the hybrid multi-model concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Warfighters, operational planners, and C2 staff familiar with hierarchical command structures.\n",
    "**Primary outcome:** The audience sees how multi-agent orchestration mirrors staff-like structures — Commander → Warfare Managers → Unit Operators — with visible reasoning selection between heuristic and LLM at each decision point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Responsible AI & Scope Statement\n",
    "> *This research explores human-AI collaboration and explainable decision-support in fully synthetic, abstract environments. All scenarios, agents, and data are artificially generated. No real-world operational data, contingency plans, systems, or intelligence are used or represented. The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority. All agent outputs are recommendations and analysis — not orders or directives. Final decisions remain with the human operator at all times.*"

    "2. **`AzureAIChatCompletionClient`** connects AutoGen to that endpoint using the [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/reference/reference-model-inference-api). This is the same API regardless of which model you deploy (GPT-4o, Mistral, Llama, etc.), so you can swap models without changing code.\n",
    "3. **`model_info`** describes the model's capabilities — AutoGen uses this metadata to decide how to format prompts (e.g., whether to use structured JSON output, function calling, or plain text).\n",
    "4. **`AzureKeyCredential`** wraps your API key into a credential object. For production workloads, consider using [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) with `DefaultAzureCredential` instead of API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Swap models easily:** Because the Azure AI Model Inference API is model-agnostic, you can change `FOUNDRY_MODEL` to any model deployed in your Azure AI Foundry project — no other code changes needed.

    "## Multi-Model Selector — Heuristic Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripted heuristic provides fast, deterministic decisions for routine situations. When the Multi-Model Selector routes to **HEURISTIC**, this engine runs instead of the LLM — demonstrating the hybrid multi-model concept where different reasoning engines are swapped based on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you wouldn't always want to call a large language model for every decision — LLM calls consume [Azure AI Foundry inference tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/costs-plan-manage) and add latency. By routing routine decisions to cheap, fast heuristics and reserving LLM reasoning for novel or complex situations, the architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduces cost** — Fewer API calls to your Azure AI endpoint.\n",
    "- **Reduces latency** — Heuristic results return instantly, no network round-trip.\n",
    "- **Improves reliability** — Scripted logic is deterministic and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern — sometimes called a \"model router\" or \"cascade\" — is a common best practice when building AI applications on Azure. You could extend it further using [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/overview) to route between different model deployments (e.g., a small model for simple queries, a large model for hard ones)."

    "- **Multi-Model Trade-off:** When heuristics were used, was speed gained without losing quality? When LLM was triggered, did it handle the novel situation better than a script could?\n",
    "- **Feedback Loop:** Did the bottom-up feedback actually change subsequent Commander recommendations, or was the hierarchy purely top-down?\n",
    "- **Degraded Operations:** Under comms degradation (Turn 3), did the Operators make reasonable autonomous recommendations while still flagging the need for human confirmation?\n",
    "- **Explainability:** Did the Explainability Agent's reasoning trace make the full decision chain auditable? Were potential cognitive biases identified?\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Were consequential actions (INTERCEPT) properly flagged for human confirmation before proceeding?\n",
    "- **Portability:** This same architecture could swap LLM for RL policies, smaller models, or rule engines — what would change?\n",
