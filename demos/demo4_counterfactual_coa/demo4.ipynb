If the preference is inconsistent, it identifies the likely cognitive bias by name and presents a structured \"appeal brief\" explaining what changed, what stayed constant, and why the recommendation does or doesn't remain valid.\n",

The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority.\n"

        "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is an open-source multi-agent framework from Microsoft Research. In version 0.7, each agent is constructed with:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`name`** — A unique identifier used in logs and orchestration.\n",
        "- **`model_client`** — The `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` configured earlier, which routes every LLM call to your Azure AI Foundry endpoint. All five agents share the same deployed model but behave differently because of their distinct system prompts.\n",
        "- **`system_message`** — A detailed prompt that defines the agent's personality, task, and output format. This is injected as the `system` role message on every API call to the Azure endpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call `agent.on_messages(...)`, AutoGen packages the conversation into the [Chat Completions request format](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions), sends it to Azure AI Foundry, and returns the model's response as a `TextMessage`.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Key insight:** The \"multi-agent\" pattern here is a *software architecture* choice, not multiple Azure deployments. All five agents call the **same** GPT-4o endpoint — the differentiation comes from prompt engineering, not infrastructure. This keeps costs and operational complexity low. Learn more about multi-agent design patterns in the [AutoGen documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/index.html).\n"

Azure AI Foundry's GPT-4o model supports context windows large enough to hold the full decision matrix across all worlds.
