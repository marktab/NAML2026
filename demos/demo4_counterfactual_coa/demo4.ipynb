    "# Demo 4 — Counterfactual COA Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**OODA Phase:** Orient / Decide (stress-testing the boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** When a planner accepts or rejects a proposed course of action, this system generates \"nearby worlds\" — scenarios differing by a single assumption — and tests whether the preference holds under those small perturbations. If the preference is inconsistent, it identifies the likely cognitive bias by name and presents a structured \"appeal brief\" explaining what changed, what stayed constant, and why the recommendation does or doesn't remain valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Military planners, wargaming staff, decision-science researchers — for research and educational purposes only\n",
    "**Primary outcome:** Surface hidden cognitive biases in COA selection through counterfactual reasoning and multi-agent analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Responsible AI & Scope Statement:** This research explores human-AI collaboration and explainable decision-support in fully synthetic, abstract environments. All scenarios, agents, and data are artificially generated. No real-world operational data, contingency plans, systems, or intelligence are used or represented. The prototype is intended exclusively for research, educational, and experimental purposes and does not constitute an operational model, validated planning tool, or source of decision authority."

    "| **Azure AI Foundry** | Hosts the large language model (GPT-4o) that each agent calls for reasoning, scoring, and analysis. Provides a managed endpoint so you don't need to run GPU hardware yourself. | [Azure AI Foundry overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio) |\n",
    "| **Azure AI Model Inference API** | A unified REST API for sending prompts to models deployed in Azure AI Foundry. The `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` in AutoGen wraps this API. | [Azure AI Model Inference API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/reference/reference-model-inference-api) |\n",
    "| **Azure Key Vault** | Securely stores API keys and connection strings so they never appear in source code. This project uses `DefaultAzureCredential` to read secrets automatically. | [Azure Key Vault overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) |\n",
    "| **Azure Machine Learning (AML)** | Provides the cloud compute environment (notebook VMs, managed compute) where this notebook can run. The bootstrap code handles AML-specific mount paths. | [Azure Machine Learning overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning) |\n",
    "| **Managed Identity & DefaultAzureCredential** | Lets the notebook authenticate to Key Vault and AI Foundry *without* embedding passwords or keys in code. In Azure it uses Managed Identity; locally it falls back to `az login`. | [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#defaultazurecredential) |\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Tip for newcomers:** You do not need deep Azure expertise to run this demo. The two key requirements are (1) an Azure AI Foundry endpoint with a deployed model, and (2) the corresponding API key — both stored securely in Azure Key Vault or set as environment variables."

    "## Agent Definitions (AutoGen 0.7.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Five `AssistantAgent` instances — each with a focused system prompt that constrains output to structured JSON for reliable downstream parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How AutoGen agents work with Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is an open-source multi-agent framework from Microsoft Research. In version 0.7, each agent is constructed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`name`** — A unique identifier used in logs and orchestration.\n",
    "- **`model_client`** — The `AzureAIChatCompletionClient` configured earlier, which routes every LLM call to your Azure AI Foundry endpoint. All five agents share the same deployed model but behave differently because of their distinct system prompts.\n",
    "- **`system_message`** — A detailed prompt that defines the agent's personality, task, and output format. This is injected as the `system` role message on every API call to the Azure endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `agent.on_messages(...)`, AutoGen packages the conversation into the [Chat Completions request format](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions), sends it to Azure AI Foundry, and returns the model's response as a `TextMessage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key insight:** The \"multi-agent\" pattern here is a *software architecture* choice, not multiple Azure deployments. All five agents call the **same** GPT-4o endpoint — the differentiation comes from prompt engineering, not infrastructure. This keeps costs and operational complexity low. Learn more about multi-agent design patterns in the [AutoGen documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/index.html)."

This is a form of **in-context learning**, where all relevant information is passed in the prompt rather than requiring fine-tuning or a separate database. Azure AI Foundry's GPT-4o model supports context windows large enough to hold the full decision matrix across all worlds. For applications that need to reason over even larger datasets, consider [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns."
